    "# Quantum-to-Classical Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final section, we introduce a general technique that essentially enables us to map\n",
    "any quantum lattice system in $d$ dimensions to a classical partition function in $d+1$\n",
    "dimensions, up to some caveats that we will return to at the end of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suzuki-Trotter decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that thermal expectation values are given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\braket{\\hat{O}} = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[\\hat{O} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}\\right]/Z(\\beta)= \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[\\mathrm{e}^{-\\beta \\hat{H}/2} \\hat{O} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\beta \\hat{H}/2}\\right]/Z(\\beta)$$\n",

    "with the thermal partition function $Z(\\beta)$ given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z(\\beta) = \\mathrm{Tr} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ground state physics is encoded in the limit $\\beta \\to \\infty$. Note that, if the\n",
    "system has a unique ground state, we can obtain the ground state $\\ket{\\Psi_0}$ of a quantum\n",
    "system by starting from essentially a random state $\\ket{\\Phi}$ and evolving it in imaginary\n",
    "time $\\tau = -\\mathrm{i} t$ for sufficiently long\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\Psi_0} \\sim \\lim_{\\tau \\to \\infty} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau \\hat{H}} \\ket{\\Phi}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding the initial state $\\ket{\\phi}$ in the energy eigenbasis of $\\hat{H}$, we see that\n",
    "the only condition is that it is not orthogonal to the ground state (subspace). In addition,\n",
    "the ground state will be well approximated if $\\tau \\Delta E \\gg 1$, with \n",
    "$\\Delta E=E_1 - E_0$ the energy gap. This imaginary time evolution also forms the basic\n",
    "ingredient of several numerical algorithms for approximating ground states of quantum many\n",
    "body systems, often in combination with the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition which is introduced\n",
    "below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this approach, the following expression for the ground state expectation value of on\n",
    "operator $\\hat{O}$ is obtained\n",

    "\n",
    "This expression can be compared to the thermal expectation value with $\\beta = 2\\tau$; the\n",
    "only difference is in the boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quantum many body system, taking the exponential is as hard as determining the full\n",
    "diagonalisation of the hamiltonian, which is impossible due to the exponentially large\n",
    "Hilbert space. If the hamiltonian is a sum of local terms, each of these terms can be\n",
    "exponentiated easily, but for arbitrary $\\tau$ there is no relation ship between\n",
    "$\\exp(-\\tau \\sum_{i} \\hat{h}_i)$ and the individual $\\exp(-\\tau \\hat{h}_i)$, unless the\n",
    "different $\\hat{h}_i$ commute. However, for an infinitesimal time step $\\epsilon$, we can\n",
    "use to Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula (or better yet, the Zassenhaus formula) to obtain\n",

    "$$\\exp(-\\epsilon \\sum_{i} \\hat{h}_i) = \\prod_i \\exp(-\\epsilon \\hat{h}_i) +\n",
    "\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^2).$$\n",

    "This then leads to the **Suzuki-Trotter decomposition**\n",

    "\n",
    "The product in the final expressions requires chosing a specific order, exactly because the terms $\\hat{h}_i$\n",
    "and thus also the factors $\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{\\tau}{M} \\hat{h}_i}$ do not commute. The approximation\n",
    "and error term are valid for arbitrary choices of ordering, but different orderings are not\n",
    "equivalent. Particular choices can be more suitable for particular purposes. Furthermore,\n",
    "note that splitting the time interval $[0,\\tau]$ into small segments $\\epsilon = \\tau/M$ is\n",
    "also the starting point for deriving a path integral representation of the quantum partition\n",
    "function. The next step is to insert a resolution of the identity in between the $N$\n",
    "different factors, where the labels of the basis will behave as classical degrees of\n",

    "in the time direction given by $M = \\beta/\\epsilon$. Hence, the ground state regime\n",
    "$\\beta\\to \\infty$ corresponds to the thermodynamic limit in this additional time direction\n",
    "of the corresponding classical system, so that there are many similarities (or actually,\n",
    "equivalences) between between quantum phenomena in $d$ dimensions and classical phenomena in\n",
    "$D=d+1$ dimensions. On the other hand, when the quantum system is at finite temperature\n",

    "particularly natural if also the spatial dimensions of the quantum dimension are continuous,\n",
    "i.e. if we have a quantum field theory. In this case, a $D=d+1$ dimensional classical\n",

    "One might thus wonder if there is anything new to be learned from studying quantum ground\n",
    "states. First of all, there is one important catch which we have overlooked so far. There is\n",
    "no guarantee that the above process yields a classical partition function with Boltzmann\n",
    "weights which are positive, or even real. While this may seem like a technical detail, it is\n",
    "of major importance. The quantum to classical mapping is the basis behind the Quantum Monte\n",
    "Carlo method, one the most successful numerical methods for studying quantum many body\n",
    "systems. One maps the quantum problem to a classical partition function and then uses one of\n",
    "the many flavours of Monte Carlo sampling. However, with non-positive Boltzmann weights, the\n",
    "interpretation of a probability distribution is lost and no efficient sampling procedure can\n",
    "be designed, as samples might annihilate each other. This is known as the **sign problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, for many non-relativistic quantum systems, the anisotropy between the imaginary\n",
    "time direction and the spatial dimensions in the corresponding classical system cannot be\n",
    "ignored, even at the critical point. In those cases, critical correlations behave\n",
    "differently in the spatial and the time direction, which is characterised by a dynamical\n",
    "critical exponent $z$. The case $z=1$ corresponds to the case where the critical point has\n",
    "(emergent) rotation/Lorentz invariance between time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final reason to study quantum systems directly is that certain concepts are more natural\n",
    "in that setting. In particular, the last 15 years, ideas from quantum information theory,\n",
    "and in particular the concept of entanglement, have made their way into the standard toolbox\n",
    "to study and characterize quantum many body systems."
