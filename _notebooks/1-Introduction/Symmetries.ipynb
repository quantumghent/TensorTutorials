    "change smoothly from two to one when the magnetic field is slowly turned on from\n",
    "$ h_x = 0 \\rightarrow \\infty $. Therefore the Ising model for small $ h_x $ and large $ h_x $ are\n",

    "where the ground state degeneracy changes abruptly is expected to take place. As it turns\n",

    "Inspired by the credo of symmetry we can introduce a local operator which probes the phase\n",
    "and can witness the phase transition. In the case of the Ising model this order parameter is\n",
    "the local magnetisation on every site: $ O=\\sum_i\\sigma^z_i $. It is clear that this order\n",

    "the expectation value of $ O $ becomes 0. So it seems that the expectation value of the order\n",

    "The synopsis of this example is thus the following. Symmetries in quantum many-body physics\n",
