The variational problem of the local update can then be solved by finding the eigenvector of $ \\mathcal{H}_i $ corresponding to the smallest real eigenvalue, and this repeatedly for every site sweeping back and forth through the chain, each time moving the orthogonality center of the MPS. At each update step a large part of the effective Hamiltonian can simply be reused, making the routine very efficient. Notice however that DMRG manifestly breaks translation invariance by updating one tensor at a time. As we will see, VUMPS does not suffer from this artefact.\n",

Nevertheless DMRG has proven itself time and time again, and is the most successful algorithm for variationally approximating the ground state of local gapped (1+1)d Hamiltonians. DMRG is implemented in MPSKit and can be called by `DMRG()`."
