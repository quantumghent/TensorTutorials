# Tensor Network Methods with Julia

This is a series of tutorials on tensor network methods and their applications in quantum
physics as well as statistical mechanics. It illustrates the theory, and aims to give
hands-on practise by providing Julia code examples, as well as showcasing the software
libraries that have been developed.

The lectures have been designed and written by Jacob Bridgeman, Lander Burgelman, Lukas
Devos, Jutho Haegeman, Daan Maertens, Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper and Kevin Vervoort.
