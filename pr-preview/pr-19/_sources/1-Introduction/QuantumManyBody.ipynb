    "While the energy levels of the hydrogen atom played an important role in the historical\n",
    "development of quantum mechanics, it became almost immediately clear that the true challenge\n",
    "is in applying the laws of quantum mechanics to systems with many interacting particles or\n",
    "fields. Note that the formalism of quantum mechanics, and in particular its postulates, are\n",
    "generically valid and not restricted to the description of a single particle. Quantum field\n",
    "theory also follows these postulates and is thus not a generalisation of quantum mechanics,\n",
    "but rather a specific case of it. These postulates characterise the mathematical model by\n",
    "which quantum mechanics describes physical systems, and more specifically how it represents\n",
    "states, observables, measurements and dynamics. We briefly reiterate this postulates and\n",

    "\n",
    "The state of an isolated quantum system is associated to a ray of vectors in a complex\n",
    "Hilbert space $\\mathbb{H}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hilbert space is a metric complete inner product space. Let us unpack this definition:\n",
    "1.  $\\mathbb{H}$ is a vector space in this case over the complex numbers. We will denote\n",
    "    elements of this vector space with Dirac's ket notation $\\ket{\\psi}$. In particular, we\n",
    "    can build linear combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{math}\n",
    "    \\ket{\\psi} = a \\ket{\\psi_1} + b \\ket{\\psi_2}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    for all $a, b \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and all $\\ket{\\psi_1}, \\ket{\\psi_2} \\in \\mathbb{H}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  $\\mathbb{H}$ has an inner product, which maps to vecors $\\ket{\\psi}$ and $\\ket{\\varphi}$\n",
    "    onto a scalar $\\braket{\\varphi|\\psi} \\in \\mathbb{C}$ with the properties of\n",
    "    * Linearity: $\\bra{\\varphi} ( a \\ket{\\psi_1} + b \\ket{\\psi_2}) = a \\braket{ \\varphi | \\psi_1} + b \\braket{ \\varphi | \\psi_2}$\n",
    "    * Skew-symmetry: $\\braket{ \\varphi | \\psi} = \\braket{ \\psi | \\varphi}^\\ast$\n",
    "\t  * Positivity: $\\braket{ \\psi | \\psi} \\geq 0$ with equality only if $\\ket{\\psi} = 0$.\n",
    "\t\n",
    " This last property enables us to define a norm $\\lVert \\psi \\rVert = \\lVert \\ket{\\psi}\n",
    " \\rVert = \\sqrt{\\braket{\\psi|\\psi}}$, which satisfies known properties such as $\\lVert \\psi\n",
    " \\rVert = 0 \\Leftrightarrow \\ket{\\psi} = 0$ $\\lVert a \\ket{\\psi} \\rVert = \\vert a\\vert\n",

    " \\leq \\lVert \\varphi \\rVert + \\lVert \\psi \\rVert$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The final property of metric completeness is a technical requirement that is only\n",
    "    relevant in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Firstly, a metric is a notation of\n",
    "    distance between the elements in $\\mathbb{H}$, which is provided by the norm of the\n",
    "    difference, i.e. $d(\\varphi, \\psi) = \\lVert \\varphi - \\psi \\rVert$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Completeness of the metric is a specific property that guarantees that certain sequences\n",
    "    of vectors are guaranteed to have a limit value that also exists in $\\mathbb{H}$. This\n",
    "    is necessary to make sense of e.g. Fourier series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of a quantum system is associated to a ray of vectors, which is the\n",
    "one-dimensional space $\\{ a \\ket{\\psi} , \\forall a \\in \\mathbb{C}\\}$ spanned by a single\n",
    "(nonzero) vector $\\ket{\\psi} \\in \\mathbb{H}$. We will describe the state of the system using\n",
    "a single representative $\\ket{\\psi}$ of this ray, which we typically choose such that\n",
    "$\\braket{ \\psi | \\psi} = 1$. However, this does not fix the representative completely, as we\n",
    "can still add arbitrary phases $\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\alpha)$, i.e. $\\ket{\\psi}$ and\n",
    "$\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\alpha} \\ket{\\psi}$ describe the same state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best known Hilbert space from your courses on single-particle quantum mechanics is\n",
    "probably $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, the Hilbert space for a single quantum particle moving in the\n",
    "$n$-dimensional coordinate space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (typically $n=1,2,3$). This Hilbert space\n",
    "corresponds to the space of all square-integrable functions $\\psi:\\mathbb{R}^d \\to\n",

    "$$\\braket{\\varphi | \\psi} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\varphi(x)^\\ast \\psi(x)\\,\\mathrm{d} x$$\n",

    "However, this is already a complicated Hilbert space from a technical perspective. Hilbert\n",
    "spaces can also be finite-dimensional, i.e. $\\mathbb{C}^d$, the space of column vectors of\n",
    "length $d$, with the standard Euclidean inner product\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\braket{\\varphi | \\psi} = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\varphi_i^\\ast \\psi_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These Hilbert spaces will be very important in our discussion. The simplest nontrivial case\n",
    "corresponds to $d=2$ and the associated quantum system is known under various names. It is\n",
    "often referred to as a qubit in the context of quantum information theory. There are various\n",
    "ways in which qubits can be physically realised. Another common example of a two-dimensional\n",
    "Hilbert space is for describing the spin degree of freedom of an electron, or another\n",
    "particle with spin quantum number 1/2. Such a reduced description (forgetting about the\n",
    "position) is possible if the electron is localised in space, for example when it is strongly\n",
    "bound to an atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do want to describe a particle that moves in space, we might also consider it to exist\n",
    "only at discrete positions in space, i.e. on a lattice. For example, on a one-dimensional\n",
    "lattice (a.k.a. a chain) with $L$ sites, the Hilbert space would also correspond to\n",
    "$\\mathbb{H} = \\mathbb{C}^L$ and the standard basis vectors $\\vert j \\rangle, j=1,\\dots,L$\n",
    "correspond to the state of the system if the particle is exactly localised on site $j$. We\n",
    "can also consider infinitely large lattices, e.g. the one-dimensional chain where there is a\n",
    "site associated with every $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (or the n-dimensional hypercubic lattice\n",
    "$\\mathbb{Z}^n$). The resulting Hilbert space is then spanned by the states $\\vert j \\rangle$\n",
    "for all $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and is thus infinite-dimensional but with a straightforward\n",
    "countably infinite basis.\n",

    "\n",
    "By exploiting the fact that this also prescribes the expectation value of all higher moments\n",
    "$\\braket{\\hat{A}^k}$, this determines the full probability distribution of the measurement\n",
    "outcome, and yields the more familiar result: The only possible measurement outcomes are\n",
    "given by the eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ of $\\hat{A}$, and for a system in state $\\ket{\\psi}$\n",

    "to the initial state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is probabilistic and can yield different results, this\n",

    "which relates states at different times via $\\ket{\\psi(t)} = \\hat{U}(t, t') \\ket{\\psi(t')}$\n",
    "and is clearly a unitary operator. Clearly, we need to know the Hamiltonian of a system in\n",
    "order to even start thinking about modelling its quantum properties. We will always assume\n",
    "that the Hamiltonian is given. In practice, however, the situation can be much more\n",
    "complicated. Typically, we want to build only an effective quantum description of the system\n",
    "(e.g. only the electrons, only certain electrons, $\\ldots$) and not start all the way down\n",

    "## The Hilbert Space of Many-Body Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the previous axioms remain valid for a composite system consisting of several quantum\n",
    "degrees of freedom. However, we need to know how to describe the state of the system, and \n",
    "thus more specifically, how to define the Hilbert space associated to such a system. It\n",
    "turns out that quantum mechanics forces us to distinguish two cases.\n",

    "Consider a quantum system composed out of two subsystems, which we call $A$ and $B$,\n",

    "already be many-body systems. Suppose we know the Hilbert space $\\mathbb{H}^A$ in which to\n",
    "describe states of subsystem $A$ when considered as an isolated system on itself, and\n",
    "analoguously for $\\mathbb{H}^B$. Now consider both systems together, but where they do not\n",
    "interact, so that we can still treat them independently. In particular, we can prepare\n",
    "subsystem $A$ in a state $\\ket{\\psi^A}$ and subsystem $B$ in a state $\\ket{\\psi^B}$. We\n",
    "should also be able to describe these two independent subsystems jointly, so that there must\n",

    "and that lives in a joint Hilbert space $\\mathbb{H}^{AB}$ that we have yet to determine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it makes sense that, if we build superpositions in one of the two subsystems, while\n",
    "keeping the other fixed, this also correspond to a superposition in the joint description of\n",
