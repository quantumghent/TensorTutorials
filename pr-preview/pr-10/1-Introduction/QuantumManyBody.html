<p>While the energy levels of the hydrogen atom played an important role in the historical
development of quantum mechanics, it became almost immediately clear that the true challenge
is in applying the laws of quantum mechanics to systems with many interacting particles or
fields. Note that the formalism of quantum mechanics, and in particular its postulates, are
generically valid and not restricted to the description of a single particle. Quantum field
theory also follows these postulates and is thus not a generalisation of quantum mechanics,
but rather a specific case of it. These postulates characterise the mathematical model by
which quantum mechanics describes physical systems, and more specifically how it represents
states, observables, measurements and dynamics. We briefly reiterate this postulates and
base our discussion on the wonderfull lecture notes “Quantum Information and Computation” by
John Preskill.</p>
<div class="section" id="postulate-1-states">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.1. </span><strong>Postulate 1: States</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#postulate-1-states" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The state of an isolated quantum system is associated to a ray of vectors in a complex
Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A Hilbert space is a metric complete inner product space. Let us unpack this definition:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> is a vector space in this case over the complex numbers. We will denote
elements of this vector space with Dirac’s ket notation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span>.
In particular, we can build linear combinations</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\psi} = a \ket{\psi_1} + b \ket{\psi_2}\]</div>
<p>for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a, b \in \mathbb{C}\)</span> and all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi_1}, \ket{\psi_2} \in \mathbb{H}\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> has an inner product, which maps to vecors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\varphi}\)</span> onto a scalar <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\varphi|\psi} \in \mathbb{C}\)</span>
with the properties that</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Linearity: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bra{\varphi} ( a \ket{\psi_1} + b \ket{\psi_2}) = a \braket{ \varphi | \psi_1} + b \braket{ \varphi | \psi_2}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Skew-symmetry: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{ \varphi | \psi} = \braket{ \psi | \varphi}^\ast\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Positivity: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{ \psi | \psi} \geq 0\)</span> with equality only if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi} = 0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This last property enables us to define a norm <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lVert \psi \rVert = \lVert \ket{\psi} \rVert = \sqrt{\braket{\psi|\psi}}\)</span>,
which satisfies known properties such as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lVert \psi \rVert = 0 \Leftrightarrow \ket{\psi} = 0\)</span>
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lVert a \ket{\psi} \rVert = \vert a\vert  \lVert \psi \rVert\)</span> and the triangle inequality
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lVert \ket{\varphi} + \ket{\psi} \rVert \leq \lVert \varphi \rVert + \lVert \psi \rVert\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The final property of metric completeness is a technical requirement that is only relevant
in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Firstly, a metric is a notation of distance between
the elements in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>, which is provided by the norm of the difference, i.e.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d(\varphi, \psi) = \lVert \varphi - \psi \rVert\)</span>.</p>
<p>Completeness of the metric is a specific property that guarantees that certain sequences
of vectors are guaranteed to have a limit value that also exists in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>. This is
necessary to make sense of e.g. Fourier series.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The state of a quantum system is associated to a ray of vectors, which is the one-dimensional
space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ a \ket{\psi} , \forall a \in \mathbb{C}\}\)</span> spanned by a single (nonzero)
vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi} \in \mathbb{H}\)</span>. We will describe the state of the system using a
single representative <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> of this ray, which we typically choose such that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{ \psi | \psi} = 1\)</span>. However, this does not fix the representative completely,
as we can still add arbitrary phases  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\exp(\mathrm{i}\alpha)\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\alpha} \ket{\psi}\)</span> describe the same state.</p>
<p>The best known Hilbert space from your courses on single-particle quantum mechanics is probably
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)\)</span>, the Hilbert space for a single quantum particle moving in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>-dimensional
coordinate space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> (typically <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=1,2,3\)</span>). This Hilbert space corresponds to the
space of all square-integrable functions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{C}: x \mapsto \psi(x)\)</span>
and the inner product is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{\varphi | \psi} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \varphi(x)^\ast \psi(x)\,\mathrm{d} x\]</div>
<p>However, this is already a complicated Hilbert space from a technical perspective. Hilbert
spaces can also be finite-dimensional, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{C}^d\)</span>, the space of column vectors of
length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>, with the standard Euclidean inner product</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{\varphi | \psi} = \sum_{i=1}^d \varphi_i^\ast \psi_i\]</div>
<p>These Hilbert spaces will be very important in our discussion. The simplest nontrivial case
corresponds to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d=2\)</span> and the associated quantum system is known under various names. It is
often referred to as a qubit in the context of quantum information theory. There are various
ways in which qubits can be physically realised. Another common example of a two-dimensional
Hilbert space is for describing the spin degree of freedom of an electron, or another particle
with spin quantum number 1/2. Such a reduced description (forgetting about the position) is
possible if the electron is localised in space, for example when it is strongly bound to an atom.</p>
<p>If we do want to describe a particle that moves in space, we might also consider it to exist
only at discrete positions in space, i.e. on a lattice. For example, on a one-dimensional
lattice (a.k.a. a chain) with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> sites, the Hilbert space would also correspond to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{C}^L\)</span> and the standard basis vectors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vert j \rangle, j=1,\dots,L\)</span>
correspond to the state of the system if the particle is exactly localised on site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>. We
can also consider infinitely large lattices, e.g. the one-dimensional chain where there is
a site associated with every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> (or the n-dimensional hypercubic lattice <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{Z}^n\)</span>).
The resulting Hilbert space is then spanned by the states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vert j \rangle\)</span> for all
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, and is thus infinite-dimensional but with a straightforward
countably infinite basis.</p>
<p>Of course, our goal is to find the Hilbert space of a many body system. We return to this
question below and devote a complete section to it.</p>

operators on the Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>.</p>
<p>An operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span> on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> is a linear map <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}:\mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{H}\)</span>,
i.e. a map from vectors to vectors that satisfies</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \hat{A}( a \ket{\varphi} + b \lvert \psi \rangle) = a \hat{A}(\ket{\varphi}) + b \hat{A}(\ket{\psi}) \]</div>
<p>The adjoint of an operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span> is a new operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}^\dagger\)</span> that is constructed
such that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \bra{\varphi} \hat{A} \psi \rangle = \langle \hat{A}^\dagger \varphi \ket{\psi} \]</div>
<p>for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\varphi}, \ket{\psi} \in \mathbb{H}\)</span> and where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vert \hat{A}\psi \rangle = \hat{A} \ket{\psi}\)</span>. This definition requires that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((a_1 \hat{A}_1 + a_2 \hat{A}_2)^\dagger = a_1^\ast \hat{A}_1^\dagger + a_2^\ast \hat{A}_2^\dagger\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\hat{A}_1 \hat{A}_2)^\dagger = \hat{A}_2^\dagger \hat{A}_1^\dagger\)</span>.</p>
<p>A self-adjoint operator is an operator such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}^\dagger = \hat{A}\)</span> or thus</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \braket{\varphi | \hat{A} \psi } = \braket{ \hat{A}^\dagger \varphi | \psi} \]</div>
<p>for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\varphi}, \ket{\psi} \in \mathbb{H}\)</span>. Linear combinations of
self-adjoint operators with real coefficients are self-adjoint. The composition of two self-adjoint
linear operators <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}_1 \hat{A}_2\)</span> is self-adjoint if and only if</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \left[ \hat{A}_1 , \hat{A}_2 \right] = \hat{A}_1 \hat{A}_2 - \hat{A}_2 \hat{A}_1 = 0, \]</div>
<p>i.e. if the operators also commute. Self-adjoint operators have real eigenvalues, and eigenvectors
associated to distinct  eigenvalues are orthogonal. In a finite-dimensional Hilbert space,
self-adjoint operators admit a spectral decomposition</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{A} = \sum_{n} \lambda_n \hat{P}_n\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}_n\)</span> is the spectral projector onto the eigenspace associated with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span>.
The spectral projectors satisfy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}_n \hat{P}_m = \delta_{n,m} \hat{P}_n\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}_n^\dagger = \hat{P}_n\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{n} \hat{P}_n = \mathbb{1}\)</span>, the identity operator. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> has one-dimensional
eigenspace spanned by the eigenvector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vert\phi_n\rangle\)</span>, then</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{P}_n = \frac{\vert \phi_n \rangle \langle \phi_n \vert}{\langle \phi_n \vert \phi_n \rangle}\]</div>
<p>where the denominator can be omitted if the eigenvector is normalised.</p>
<p>In the language of matrices, these properties can be rephrased as follows: With respect to an
orthonormal basis choice, self-adjoint operators are represented as hermitian matrices. Such
matrices can be diagonalised by a unitary transformation, or thus, we can construct a complete
basis consisting of eigenvectors. With respect to this basis, the self-adjoint operator is
represented by a diagonal matrix with real values on the diagonal.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.3. </span><strong>Postulate 3: Measurements, expectation values and collapse</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#postulate-3-measurements-expectation-values-and-collapse" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Given an observable to which we associate the operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span>, we now need to prescribe
the result of measuring this observable with respect to a system that is in a state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span>.
The most compact way of describing the result is by stating that, the expectation value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\hat{A}}\)</span>
(= the  mean value of the measurement when averaging over an ensemble of identical copies of the system)
is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \braket{\hat{A}} = \frac{\braket{\psi \vert \hat{A} \vert \psi}}{\braket{\psi \vert \psi}} \]</div>
<p>By exploiting the fact that this also prescribes the expectation value of all higher moments
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\hat{A}^k}\)</span>, this determines the full probability distribution of the measurement
outcome, and yields the more familiar result: The only possible measurement outcomes are
given by the eigenvalues <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span>, and for a system in state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span>
(now assumed normalized), the probability of obtaining <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> is given by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n = \braket{\psi \vert \hat{P}_n \vert \psi}\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}_n\)</span> the spectral projector from
above. In the case that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> has a single (linearly independent) eigenvector
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\phi_n}\)</span> (also assumed normalised), this amounts to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n = \vert \braket{\phi_n|\psi}\vert^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is a second part to the measurement postulate, which states that, if the measurement
is immediately repeated (without intermediate dynamcis, as described by the next postulate),
then the same measurement outcome is obtained. Because the measurement outcome with respect
to the initial state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> is probabilistic and can yield different results, this
requires that after the first measurement, the state changes is changed. This is the
well-known <strong>collapse</strong> of the wave function. More specifically, if a measurement of
observable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span> is performed in a system with state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> and the measurement
value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> is obtained, then the state of the system changes to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \ket{\psi} \longrightarrow \frac{\hat{P}_n \ket{\psi}}{\lVert \hat{P}_n \ket{\psi}\rVert}. \]</div>
<p>Note that the denominator cannot vanish, as otherwise the probability of having obtained
measurement outcome <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> would have been zero in the first place.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.4. </span><strong>Postulate 4: Dynamics</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#postulate-4-dynamics" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>During time intervals without measurements, the state of an isolated quantum system evolves
unitarily according to the (first order linear) differential equation</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\ }{\mathrm{d} t} \ket{\psi(t)} = - \mathrm{i} \hat{H}(t) \ket{\psi(t)}\]</div>
<p>known as the Schr”{o}dinger equation, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}(t)\)</span> is the Hamiltonian of the system,
which may itself be time-dependent. In the case of a time-independent Hamiltonian, we can
define the evolution operator</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ U(t, t') = \exp\left(-\mathrm{i}(t-t')\hat{H}\right) \]</div>
<p>which relates states at different times via <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi(t)} = \hat{U}(t, t') \ket{\psi(t')}\)</span>
and is clearly a unitary operator. Clearly, we need to know the Hamiltonian of a system in
order to even start thinking about modelling its quantum properties. We will always assume
that the Hamiltonian is given. In practice, however, the situation can be much more
complicated. Typically, we want to build only an effective quantum description of the system
(e.g. only the electrons, only certain electrons, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ldots\)</span>) and not start all the way down
at the level of fundamental particles and the standard model (which is also only an
effective model valid up to some energy scale).</p>

<p>All of the previous axioms remain valid for a composite system consisting of several quantum
degrees of freedom. However, we need to know how to describe the state of the system, and
thus more specifically, how to define the Hilbert space associated to such a system. It
turns out that quantum mechanics forces us to distinguish two cases.</p>
<div class="section" id="distinguisable-particles-and-tensor-products">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.1. </span>Distinguisable particles and tensor products<a class="headerlink" href="#distinguisable-particles-and-tensor-products" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider a quantum system composed out of two subsystems, which we call <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, sometimes
referred to as Alice and Bob in quantum information context. These can themselves already
be many-body systems. Suppose we know the Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A\)</span> in which to describe
states of subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> when considered as an isolated system on itself, and analoguously
for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^B\)</span>. Now consider both systems together, but where they do not interact,
so that we can still treat them independently. In particular, we can prepare subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>
in a state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^A}\)</span> and subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> in a state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^B}\)</span>. We should also be
able to describe these two independent subsystems jointly, so that there must exist a map
from the two arguments <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\ket{\psi^A}, \ket{\varphi^B}) \in \mathbb{H}^A \times \mathbb{H}^B\)</span>
to a single state which we denote as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{ \psi^A} \otimes \ket{\varphi^B}\)</span> and that lives
in a joint Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{AB}\)</span> that we have yet to determine.</p>
<p>Now, it makes sense that, if we build superpositions in one of the two subsystems, while keeping
the other fixed, this also correspond to a superposition in the joint description of both
systems together. This leads to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \left (a_1 \ket{\psi^A_1} + a_2 \ket{\psi^A_2}\right) \otimes \ket{\varphi^B} = a_1 \ket{\psi^A_1 }\otimes \ket{\varphi^B} + a_2 \ket{\psi^A_1 }\otimes \ket{\varphi^B}\]</div>
<p>and similarly</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \ket{\psi^A} \otimes \left(b_1 \ket{\varphi^B_1} + b_2 \ket{\varphi^A_2}\right) = b_1 \ket{\psi^A }\otimes \ket{\varphi^B_1} + b_2 \ket{\psi^A }\otimes \ket{\varphi^B_2}.\]</div>
<p>Hence, the Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{AB}\)</span> that we are trying to construct must contain
all states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^A} \otimes \ket{\varphi^B}\)</span> for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^A} \in \mathbb{H}^A\)</span> and
all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\varphi^B} \in \mathbb{H}^B\)</span>, all possible linear combinations thereof (in order to
be a vector space), but in such a way that the above equalities hold. This construction, which
can be made mathematically precise, is known as the tensor product of vector spaces
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{AB} = \mathbb{H}^A \otimes \mathbb{H}^B\)</span>.</p>
<p>We have also denoted the output of the map from two states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\ket{\psi^A}, \ket{\varphi^B}) \in \mathbb{H}^A \times \mathbb{H}^B\)</span>
to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A \otimes \mathbb{H}^B\)</span> using the same tensor product symbol, and refer to
such a state as a (tensor) product state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{ \psi^A} \otimes \ket{\varphi^B}\)</span>. Importantly,
however, the tensor product space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A \otimes \mathbb{H}^B\)</span> certainly contains vectors
which are not product states, such as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ a_1 \ket{ \psi_1^A} \otimes \ket{\varphi_1^B} + a_2 \ket{ \psi_2^A} \otimes \ket{\varphi_2^B}. \]</div>
<p>This forms the basis for quantum correlations and the concept of (quantum) entanglement, which
will be a fundamental property of quantum many-body systems. That the Hilbert space of a
composite system is given by the tensor product of the individual Hilbert spaces is often
introduced as a separate axiom. The deductive (but informal) argument just given can however
be turned into a proof that depends only on the axioms given above (in fact only on the first two).</p>
<p>As expected (and required), it can be shown that the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces is
again a Hilbert space, if we define its inner inner product in the following way.
We first define the inner product for product states as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \braket{\psi_1^A \otimes \varphi_1^B | \psi_2^A \otimes \varphi_2^B } = \braket{\psi_1^A | \psi_2^A} \braket{\varphi_1^B | \varphi_2^B} \]</div>
<p>and then extend this definition by linearity (in the second argument and antilinearity in the first argument).</p>
<p>In practice, given two finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A \cong \mathbb{C}^{d_A}\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^B \cong \mathbb{C}^{d_B}\)</span> with a basis <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ \ket{j}, j=1,\dots, d_A\}\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{k}, k=1,\dots, d_B\}\)</span>, the tensor product space is spanned by a basis composed
of all products</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\{ \ket{j,k} = \ket{j} \otimes \ket{k}, j=1,\dots, d_A, k=1,\dots, d_B\}\]</div>
<p>and thus has dimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_A \cdot d_B\)</span>. A general state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi} \in \mathbb{H}^{A}\otimes \mathbb{H}^B\)</span>
can then be expanded as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \ket{\Psi} = \sum_{j=1}^{d_A }\sum_{k=1}^{d_B} \Psi_{jk} \ket{j,k} \]</div>
<p>The expansion coefficients <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Psi_{jk}\)</span> thus have two indices, and it is often useful to
think of them as a matrix. Note that we will almost always use this product basis, also
sometimes referred to as the computational basis, for working with tensor product spaces.
However, one can certainly also use more complicated basis choices, where the basis vectors
are not simple product states. One well known choice that you might remember from your
quantum mechanics course is in the case of two spin-1/2 systems. If we denote the basis for
a single spin-1/2 system as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\uparrow},\ket{\downarrow}\}\)</span>, then the product basis
for a system consisting of two spin-1/2 systems is given by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\uparrow,\uparrow}, \ket{\downarrow,\uparrow}, \ket{\uparrow,\downarrow}, \ket{\downarrow,\downarrow}, \}\)</span>.
However, in the context of spin coupling (see Section on Symmetries), one also uses the
coupled basis</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\ket{0,0} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{\uparrow,\downarrow} - \ket{\downarrow,\uparrow}\right)\\
\ket{1,1} &amp;= \ket{\uparrow,\uparrow}\\
\ket{1,0} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{\uparrow,\downarrow} + \ket{\downarrow,\uparrow}\right)\\
\ket{1,-1} &amp;= \ket{\downarrow,\downarrow}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Note that we also use the same tensor product notation as an operation to map operators from
the subsystems into operators acting on the full tensor product Hilbert space. In
particular, the process of measuring operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span> in subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and simultaneously
operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{B}\)</span> in subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> is associated with an operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\otimes \hat{B}\)</span>
acting on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A \otimes \mathbb{H}^B\)</span>, the action of which is first defined on the
product states as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\left(\hat{A} \otimes \hat{B}\right) \left(\ket{\psi^A}\otimes \ket{\varphi^B}\right) = \left(\hat{A}\ket{\psi^A}\right) \otimes \left(\hat{B}\ket{\varphi^B}\right) \]</div>
<p>and then extended by linearity. With respect to a product basis, the matrix representation
of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(\hat{A} \otimes \hat{B}\right)\)</span> is given by the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product">Kronecker product</a>.</p>
<p>When we are only interested in an operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{O}\)</span> acting on subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> without doing
anything on subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, we should create the operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{O} \otimes \hat{1}_B\)</span>, with
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{1}_B\)</span> the identity operator of the Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^B\)</span>. Often, we will omit
this explicit tensor product with the identity operator, and simply use some notation which
indicates that an operator acts on a certain subsystem, such as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{O}^{(A)} = \hat{O} \otimes \hat{1}_B\)</span>. This also makes it explicit that operators
defined on different subsystems, when lifted to act on the full Hilbert space, commute, i.e.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \left[\hat{O}_1^{(A)} , \hat{O}_2^{(B)}\right] = \left[ \hat{O}_1 \otimes \hat{1}_B, \hat{1}_A \otimes \hat{O}_2\right] = 0. \]</div>
<p>The tensor product construction extends readily to systems with multiple subsystems.
Consider for example a system consisting of qubits, where every individual qubit has an
associated Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{C}^2\)</span> with basis denoted as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}\)</span>. The
Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^N\)</span> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> qubits is then spanned by a computational basis which we
can denote as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\{\ket{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N} = \ket{s_1} \otimes \ket{s_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{s_N}; s_1 =0,1; s_2 =0,1; \ldots; s_n =0,1\}.\]</div>
<p>Hence, the Hilbert space thus has dimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^N\)</span>, and a general state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span> has
expansion coefficients</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Psi_{s_1,s_2, \ldots, s_N}\]</div>
<p>which can be interpreted as a single vector of length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^N\)</span>, or as a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>-dimensional tensor,
where every tensor index ranges over the two values 0 and 1. This exponential increase of
the Hilbert space dimension with the number of particles is exactly why the quantum
many-body problem is so difficult, but also essential for providing a quantum computer with
its speed-up.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian of a many-body system typically takes the form of a sum of terms, where
every individual term acts nontrivially on only a few subsystems. One important example that
will reappear throughout these tutorials is the “Quantum Ising Model with transverse
magnetic field”, which acts on a system composed of qubits or spin-1/2 particles, and is
defined as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \hat{H} = - J \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} \sigma^z_i \otimes \sigma^z_j - h \sum_i \sigma^x_i \]</div>
<p>Here, the summation variables <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> correspond to the sites of a lattice. The notation
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}\)</span> denotes a sum over pairs of neighbouring lattice sites <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>. The second sum contains terms <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma^x_i\)</span> which act nontrivially only on the site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>,
and as the identity operator elsewhere. If, for example, we enumerate the sites from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>, it would act as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \sigma^x_i = \underbrace{1 \otimes 1 \otimes \ldots \otimes 1}_{\text{$i-1$ factors}} \otimes \sigma^x \otimes \underbrace{1 \otimes \ldots \otimes 1}_{\text{$N-i-1$ factors}}\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma^x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}\)</span> the Pauli x matrix, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>
the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 x 2\)</span> unit matrix. The first set of terms in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}\)</span> acts nontrivially on two sites,
and is defined analoguously, using the Pauli z matrices
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma^z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}\)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.2. </span>Identical particles and Pauli’s exclusion principle<a class="headerlink" href="#identical-particles-and-pauli-s-exclusion-principle" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The tensor product construction needs to be revised when discussing the Hilbert space of a
system composed of identical particles. Consider for example a system made out of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>
identical particles. To every individual particle we can associate a particular Hilbert
space, which we denote as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\)</span>, for example <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)} = L^2(\mathbb{R})\)</span>
for a particle moving on the real line, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)} = \mathbb{C}^L\)</span> for a particle living
on the sites of a chain of length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we temporarily assign each of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> particles a label <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=1,\dots, N\)</span>, then the Hilbert
space of the composite system would be given by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>-fold tensor product
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\widetilde{\mathbb{H}}^{(N)} = \left(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\right)^{\otimes N}\)</span>. However, for identical particles,
our labeling is completely arbitrary. For the case of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=2\)</span> particles on a chain of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> sites,
we cannot distinguish between the state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j_1, j_2}\)</span> where particle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> is on site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_1\)</span>
and particle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\)</span> is on site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_2\)</span> versus the state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j_2, j_1}\)</span> where site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_1\)</span> is occupied
by the particle that we gave label <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\)</span> and site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_2\)</span> is occupied by the particle with label <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>.
A general redefinition of the particle labels amounts to a permutation, and we have to require
that no physical measurement can distinguish between such permutations. Hence, this permutation
invariance does not behave like a regular symmetry (like e.g. rotation symmetry, one can still construct
observables along preferred directions such that they can detect rotations).</p>
<p>We are forced to restrict our tensor product Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\right)^{\otimes N}\)</span>
to the subspace <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(N)}\)</span> of physical states which are not affected by acting with
such permutations. Note that, due to the fact that quantum states actually correspond to rays
of vectors, it is still allowed that the vectors in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(N)}\)</span> pick up a phase factor
when applying certain permutations. It is a result in the representation theory of the
permutation group that there are only two possibilities. Either the phase factor is always
absent (or thus 1), or the phase factor is (-1) for odd permutations and (+1) for even
permutations, i.e. the phase factor equals the sign(ature) of the permutation. Identical particles
for which the phase factor is always one are known as <em>bosons</em>, whereas those with the nontrival
phase factor choice correspond to <em>fermions</em>. Indeed, the nontrivial phase factor automatically
gives rise to <em>Pauli’s exclusion principle</em>: two fermions cannot be in the same quantum state,
since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{12} \ket{j_1,j_2} = \ket{j_2,j_1} = -\ket{j_1,j_2}\)</span> and for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_1=j_2\)</span> we would thus
find <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j,j} = -\ket{j,j}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Bosons are thus described by states which are symmetric under permutations, whereas fermions
are described by states which are called antisymmetric. We can define an operator on
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{\mathbb{H}}^{(N)} = \)</span>\left(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\right)^{\otimes N}$ that maps any given
state onto such a (anti)symmeric state, namely by first defining its action on product states
as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \hat{S}^{\pm} \ket{\psi_1} \otimes \ket{\psi_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{\psi_N} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{\sigma \in S_N} \epsilon_\sigma \ket{\psi_{\sigma(1)}} \otimes \ket{\psi_{\sigma(2)}} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{\psi_{\sigma(N)}} \]</div>
<p>and then extending it by linearity. Here, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_N\)</span> is the symmetric group containing all permutations
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> elements, where the permutation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> is a bijective map from integers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j \in \{1,\dots,N\}\)</span>
to a new number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma(j) \in \{1,\dots,N\}\)</span>. The sign(ature) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon_\sigma\)</span> of the permutation
takes the value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+1\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-1\)</span>, depending on whether the permutation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> can be obtained
by composing an even or odd number of elementary transpositions. An elementary transposition
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_{i,j}\)</span> is a permutation which only interchanges the two numbers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j \neq i\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\tau_{i,j}(i) =j, \tau_{i,j}(j) = i, \tau_{i,j}(k) =k, \forall k\neq i \land k \neq j \]</div>
<p>Note that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{\pm}\)</span> does not necessarily yield a normalised state, and can indeed even
map a state to zero, in order to give rise to Pauli’s exclusion principle: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^- \ket{j,j} = 0\)</span>.
The image of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{\pm}\)</span> contains all states with the proper behaviour under relabeling
permutations, and thus correspond to the physical Hilbert space for bosons or fermions:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \mathbb{H}^{(N)} = \hat{S}^{\pm} \widetilde{\mathbb{H}}^{(N)} = \hat{S}^{\pm} \left(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\right)^{\otimes N} \]</div>
<p>Note that in this case, the physical Hilbert space is not a tensor product. We had to define
a larger auxiliary Hilbert space, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \widetilde{\mathbb{H}}^{(N)}\)</span>, which is a tensor product.
The physical Hilbert space can then be thought of as a subspace thereof. This situation also
occurs in other places, most notably, in the case of gauge theories.</p>
<p>Now consider a single particle Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\)</span> with an orthonormal basis
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{j}, j=1,\ldots,L\}\)</span>, for example where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j}\)</span> corresponds to the particle being
positioned on site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> of a lattice with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> sites. We also refer to these single particle
states as modes. To construct a basis for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(N)}\)</span>, we can start from the tensor
product basis of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\widetilde{\mathbb{H}}^{(N)}\)</span> and apply <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{\pm}\)</span> to each of its
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L^N\)</span> elements. Let us henceforth denote these states as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \ket{j_1,j_2,\ldots ,j_N} = \hat{S}^{\pm} \left(\ket{j_1} \otimes \ket{j_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{j_N}\right)\]</div>
<p>The application of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{\pm}\)</span> will create certain linear dependences. In particular, states
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \ket{j_1,j_2, \ldots, j_N}\)</span> that contain the same set of modes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span>, i.e. for which the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span>’s
are related by a permutation, are equal (up to a sign in the case of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^-\)</span>). We can thus select
a single state by ordering the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span> arguments. Furthermore, in the case of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{-}\)</span>, the
state is mapped to zero as soon as two <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span> values coincide, so we can eliminate such states. If we
thus restrict the set to states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j_1,j_2,\ldots ,j_N}\)</span> which are such that the modes are
ordered as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_1 &lt; j_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; j_N\)</span> (for fermions) or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_1 \leq j_2 \leq \ldots \leq j_N\)</span> (for bosons),
then we have a linearly indepenent set of states. For fermions, this implies in particular that
we need to have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N \leq L\)</span>, there cannot be more fermions in the system then there are linearly
independent modes (single particle states).</p>
<p>Finally, one can wonder about the normalisation of these states. For fermions, the superposition
created by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^-\)</span> contains <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N!\)</span> terms, which are mutually orthogonal, so that the
resulting state is normalised (because of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\sqrt{N!}\)</span> prefactor in the definition of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{-}\)</span>. More generally, one then finds</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; i_N | j_1 &lt; j_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; j_N} = \delta_{i_1,j_1} \delta_{i_2,j_2} \cdots \delta_{i_N,j_N}\]</div>
<p>For bosons, the situation is more complicated in the case that some <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span> values coincide.
Some of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N!\)</span> terms created by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^+\)</span> are then equal and contribute differently to
the norm. If we denote with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L\)</span> the number of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> values that equal
the value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1, 2, \ldots, L\)</span>, i.e. the number of particles in mode <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1, 2, \ldots, L\)</span>,
then we find</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{i_1 \leq i_2 \leq \ldots \leq i_N | j_1 \leq j_2 \leq \ldots \leq j_N} = (n_1! n_2! \cdots n_L!) \delta_{i_1,j_1} \delta_{i_2,j_2} \cdots \delta_{i_N,j_N}\]</div>
<p>This more general exprression is also valid for fermions, where every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j\)</span> is restricted to be
zero or one. In fact, the values <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j=1,\ldots,L\)</span> completely characterise the state, and
can thus be used to relabel the basis. Instead of specifying the mode <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span>
that each particle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k=1,\ldots,N\)</span> occuppies (where the labeling of the particles is arbitrary
because they are identical), we can move to a mode-based description and thus specify the
number of particles in each mode, also known as the mode occupation number. We can then
refer to the basis vectors as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j = 0, 1\)</span> (fermions) or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j = 0,1,2, \ldots \)</span> (bosons) and furthermore
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{j=1}^{L} n_j = N\)</span>. Furthermore, we define these states to be normalised to 1, i.e. we
absorb a suitable normalisation factor when defining <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L}\)</span> in terms
of the construction above.</p>
<p>This way of labelling the basis states now is again reminiscent of a tensor product structure,
i.e.\ we could think of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L}\)</span> as the tensor product of states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{n_j}\)</span>
associated to every mode, and where the Hilbert space associated with such a mode is two-dimensional
in the case of fermions, or infinite-dimensional in the case of bosons.  However, there is still
a global constraint <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{j=1}^{L} n_j = N\)</span> so that we cannot let the different <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j\)</span> values
vary completely independently from each other. Furthermore, some caution is now needed as to
what it means to have operators acting on these different “mode Hilbert spaces”. The correct
formalism is that of second quantisation, which we introduce next.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In many applications, people do still work with the framework of first quantisation, and consider
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>-particle states constructed by symmetrising or antisymmetrising the tensor product of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> single-particle states, in a so-called independent particle model or approximation.
Such states are quite cumbersome to work with. As can already be seen,
the antisymmetric case is slightly easier and is known as a Slater determinant. Indeed, the
antisymmetrisation formula is reminiscent of the Leibniz formula of a determinant, and for
example the inner product between two Slater determinants constructed from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\psi_n},n=1,\ldots,N\}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\varphi_n},n=1,\ldots,N\}\)</span> is given by the determinant of the matrix containing all
overlaps <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\varphi_m \vert \psi_n}\)</span>. Slater determinants form the basis of Hartree-Fock
theory for approximating the state of electrons in an atom or molecule.</p>
<p>The bosonic version occurs in the context of Bose-Einstein condensation and cold atom systems
more generally. In that case, the inner product between two such states gives rise to a
determinant-like formula, but without the minus signs. This construction is known as the
permenant, but unlike the determinant it is very hard to compute in general and really requires
to explicitly sum up all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N!\)</span> terms.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.3. </span>Fock space and second quantisation<a class="headerlink" href="#fock-space-and-second-quantisation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>However, there is an easier formalism that is furthermore required when dealing with systems
in which the precise number of particles <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> might fluctuate. While non-relativistic processes
do typically not create new particles, this can still be useful for providing an effective
or approximate description. For example, the BCS theory of superconductivity is constructed
by transforming into a description where the number of Cooper pairs can fluctuate.</p>
<p>We start by defining the Fock space, which is the direct sum of all physical (symmetrised or
antisymmetrised) Hilbert spaces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(N)}\)</span> for different particle numbers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>, going
all the way from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=0\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbb{H} = \bigoplus_{N=0}^{+\infty} \mathbb{H}^{(N)}\]</div>
<p>Note that we have not discussed the case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=0\)</span> before, as in the previou subsection we started
the construction of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(N)}\)</span> from a given single particle Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\)</span>.
When there are no particles in the system, there is only a single state in which it can be.
Hence, for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=0\)</span> particles, the Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(0)}\)</span> is spanned by a single state,
which we typically denote as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{0}\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Omega}\)</span> and refer to as the <em>vacuum state</em>.
We choose this state to be normalised, and thus note that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{0}\)</span> is very different from
a the zero vector of the vector space, which has norm zero.</p>
<p>The Fock space becomes a Hilbert space simply by incorporating the inner product from each
of its summands. States within the different summands of this direct sum are defined
to be orthogonal, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\varphi^{(M)} \vert \psi^{(N)}}=0\)</span> for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span>-particle states
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\varphi^{(M)}}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>-particle states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^{(N)}}\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M \neq N\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given the above mode occupation numbers, we can now use the states</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\{\ket{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_L}, n_j = 0,1\ \text{or}\ n_j = 0,1,2,\ldots\}\]</div>
<p>as basis, where the global constraint can now be omitted. Aside from losing the global
constraint, we have so far not yet gained anything and the different particle number sectors
cannot yet easily be related to each other. Hereto, we now introduce a set of operators on
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> which relate these different sectors by creating or annihilating a particle.</p>

<p>Having introduced the Hilbert space and Hamiltonian of quantum many-body systems, we still
need to define which states we are actually interested in. So far, we have only mentioned
that isolated systems have a quantum state which corresponds to a vector (or rather a ray of
vectors) in its Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="quantum-states-revisited">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.4.1. </span>Quantum states revisited<a class="headerlink" href="#quantum-states-revisited" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>More abstractly and generally, the quantum state of a system can be introduced as a map from
observables (operators) to numbers (expectation values). This is typically denoted as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho: \mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H}) \mapsto \mathbb{C}:\hat{A} \to \hat{A}\)</span>. Here, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H})\)</span>
is the set of linear operators (a.k.a endomorphisms) on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>. This set is itself a
vector space, as we can consider linear combinations of linear operators. Furthermore, as we
can compose linear operators, we have a multiplication, which makes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H})\)</span>
into an algebra. Finally, we have defined the concept of the adjoint of an operator, which in
mathematics terminology gives <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H})\)</span> the structure of a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C^\ast\)</span>-algebra.</p>
<p>The map <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span> that represents a quantum state should have a number of properties, that generalise
those of the case we have encountered so far, where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho(\hat{A}) = \frac{\braket{\Psi\vert \hat{A} \vert \Psi}}{\braket{\Psi | \Psi}}\)</span>. In particular,
this map is linear with respect to linear combinations of operators. This implies that it can
be written as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho(\hat{A}) = \mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{\rho}\hat{A}\right]\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span> is now
itself an element of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H})\)</span>. Furthermore, we must have that our state
gives rise to nonnegative and normalised probabilities, which implies that</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho(\hat{1}) = \mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{\rho}\right] = 1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho(\hat{P}) \geq 0\)</span> for any projector, and more generally, for any positive definite operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}\)</span>.
This implies that the associated operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span>, known as the <strong>density operator</strong> or
density matrix (when expressed with respect to a chosen basis), is itself a positive (and thus
self-adjoint) operator, which is furthermore normalised to have trace one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The particular case where the state of the system was given by a vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi} \in \mathbb{H}\)</span>
corresponds to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho} = \frac{\ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi}}{\braket{\Psi\vert \Psi}}\)</span> and thus
satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^2 = \hat{\rho}\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span> is itself a projector. Such states are called
<em>pure states</em>. All density operators which do not have this property are called <em>mixed states</em>.</p>
<p>Being positive definite operators, any density operator admits a spectral decomposition of the
form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \hat{\rho} = \sum_{n} p_n \ket{\Phi_n}\bra{\Phi_n} \]</div>
<p>where the states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\Phi_n}\}\)</span> form an orthonormal set and the eigenvalues <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n\)</span> satisfy
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{n} p_n =1 \)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n \geq 0\)</span> (which together also yields <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n &lt; 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>Mixed states arise in the quantum world in two scenarios:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Even for an isolated system, it can happen that the state is not exaclty known and one
must deal with classical uncertaintity and probability. Indeed, a mixed state can be
interpreted as a statistical ensemble. If the system can be prepared into different
(not necessarily orthogonal) states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\Psi_1}, \ket{\Psi_2}, \ldots\}\)</span> with probabilities
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_1, p_2, \ldots\)</span> that sum up to one, then the state of the system is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{\rho} = p_1 \ket{\Psi_1}\bra{\Psi_1} + p_2 \ket{\Psi_2}\bra{\Psi_2} + \ldots \]</div>
<p>Note that this does not necessarily correspond to the spectral decomposition of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span>, as the states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi_i}\)</span> are not necessarily orthogonal. It is
nonetheless a valid density operator. More generally, given two density operator
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}_2\)</span>, aany convex combination
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho} = p \hat{\rho}_1 + (1-p) \hat{\rho}_2\)</span> with thus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0 \leq p \leq 1\)</span> is a
valid density operator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the system is not isolated, but is rather a subsystem of a larger system and interacting with
its complement therein. This is discussed in the next section.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To a mixed state, we can associate the Von Neumann entropy</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ S(\hat{\rho}) = - \mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{\rho}\log \hat{\rho}\right] = - \sum_{n} p_n \log(p_n)\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n\)</span> the eigenvalues of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span>. For a pure state, the Von Neumann entropy
evaluates to zero (using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lim_{x\to 0} x \log x = 0\)</span>). Depending on the context, the
interpretation and meaning of the Von Neumann entropy can differ, as we discuss below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="from-tensor-products-to-mixed-states-and-entanglement">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.4.2. </span>From tensor products to mixed states and entanglement<a class="headerlink" href="#from-tensor-products-to-mixed-states-and-entanglement" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider a bipartite system composed of two subsystems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, with thus
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{H}^{(A)} \otimes \mathbb{H}^{(B)}\)</span>. Now suppose that we are only
interested in measuring observables that act non-trivially on subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. This might be
the case if subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is the actual quantum system that we want to model, but it is not
isolated and instead interacting with an environment, corresponding to subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. With
the axioms so far, we are forced to include the environment into our discussion. Only the
combined system + environment can be assigned a pure state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span>. However, this seems
complete overkill, as the environment might extend the whole universe and so it will be
impossible to know the complete state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span>. Since we are only interested in
observables that act nontrivially on the system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, i.e. all observables that we want to
measure take the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{O}^A = \hat{O} \otimes \hat{1}_B\)</span>, and thus we expect that a
reduced and simplified description must exist.</p>
<p>Let us now assume that the Hilbert space of subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is spanned by a basis
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\psi_k}, k=1,\dots, d^A\}\)</span> and the Hilbert space of subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> is spanned by a
basis <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\varphi_l}, l=1,\ldots, d^B\}\)</span>. A reduced description for the system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> can
be obtained by observing that we can write</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\braket{\Psi \vert \hat{O}^A \vert \Psi} &amp;= \mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{O} \otimes \hat{1}_B \ket{\Psi} \bra{\Psi}\right]\\
&amp;= \sum_{k = 1}^{d^A}\sum_{l = 1}^{d^B} \left(\bra{\psi_k} \otimes \bra{\varphi_l}\right) \left(\hat{O} \otimes \hat{1}_B\right) \ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi}\left(\ket{\psi_k} \otimes \ket{\varphi_l}\right)\\
&amp;= \sum_{k = 1}^{d^A}] \bra{\psi_k} \hat{O} \left[ \sum_{l=1}^{d_B} \bra{\varphi_l} \ket{\Psi} \bra{\Psi} \ket{\varphi_l}\right] \ket{\psi_k}\\
&amp;= \mathrm{Tr}_A \left[\hat{O} \mathrm{Tr}_B\left(\ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi} \right)\right]\\
&amp;= \mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{O} \hat{\rho}^{(A)}\right]\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Hence, subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> an be described in terms of a mixed state that is obtained as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \hat{\rho}^A = \mathrm{Tr}_B \ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi} = \sum_{l=1}^{d_B} \bra{\varphi_l} \ket{\Psi} \bra{\Psi} \ket{\varphi_l} \]</div>
<p>This construction is known as a <em>partial trace</em> and the resulting mixed state of subsystem
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> as the <em>reduced density operator</em>. It is based on the fact that by using a tensor
product basis for the joint Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{H}^{(A)} \otimes
\mathbb{H}^{(B)}\)</span>, a trace operation leads to a double sum, namely one over all basis
vectors for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A\)</span> and one over all basis vectors for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^B\)</span>. Hence, the
complete trace can be interpreted as the composition of two partial traces, one over
subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and one over subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. If all relevant operators act trivially on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>,
the partial trace over <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> can be performed directly on the state
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^{(AB)} = \ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi}\)</span> and gives rise to the reduced density matrix
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^{(A)}\)</span>. Some notes are in order.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>While we made reference to a specific tensor product basis to define this construction,
the concepts of reduced density operator and partial trace do not depend on the specific

find
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^{(AB)} = \sum_{k,k'=1}^{d^A} \sum_{l,l'=1}^{d^B} \Psi_{k,l} \Psi_{k',l'}^\ast \left(\ket{k}\otimes \ket{l}\right) \left(\bra{k'}\otimes \bra{l'}\right)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(

</ul>
<p>If the reduced density operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^A\)</span> is pure, this indicates that the state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span>
was itself a tensor product. In all other cases, the subsystems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> are said to be
entangled. This entanglement can be quantified by computing the Von Neumann entropy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\hat{\rho}^A)\)</span>,
which is then called the <strong>entanglement entropy</strong> of the combined system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. Indeed,
that this entropy is a property of how both subsystems are entangled follows from the fact that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\hat{\rho}^A) = S(\hat{\rho}^B)\)</span>, i.e.\ it doesn’t matter whether the Von Neumann entropy
of the reduced density operator of subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> or of subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> is computed. This is only
true if the total system is in a pure state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span>. When also the total system is in a
mixed state, because of classical randomness, then it is harder to differentiate between
true quantum entanglement and classical probability.</p>
<p>To conclude, we analyse the case where the combined system is in a pure state a bit more.
If we again expand <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span> with respect to the tensor product basis as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\Psi} = \sum_{k=1}^{d^A} \sum_{l=1}^{d^B} \Psi_{k,l} \ket{k}\otimes \ket{l}\]</div>
<p>and interpret its expansion coefficients <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Psi_{k,l}\)</span> as the entries of a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^A \times d^B\)</span>
matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span>. The reduced density operators can now be written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{\rho}^A = \sum_{k,k'=1}^{d^A} [C C^\dagger]_{k,k'} \ket{k}\bra{k'}\quad \text{and}\quad\hat{\rho}^A = \sum_{k,k'=1}^{d^A} [C^\dagger C]_{l,l'} \ket{l}\bra{l'}\]</div>
<p>Hence, the reduced density matrices for subsystems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> are related by the fact that
they correspond to the two different ways in which we can multiply the matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> with its
Hermitian conjugate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C^\dagger\)</span>. It is a well-known result from linear algebra that for two
matrices <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A \in \mathbb{C}^{d_1 \times d_2}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B \in \mathbb{C}^{d_2 \times d_1}\)</span>, the
square matrices <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A B \in \mathbb{C}^{d_1 \times d_1}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(BA \in \mathbb{C}^{d_2 \times d_2}\)</span>
have the same set of nonzero eigenvalues, counted with degeneracy. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_1 \neq d_2\)</span>, the
larger of the two matrices will have additional eigenvalues zero. This result already
proofs the equality <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\hat{\rho}^{(A)}) = S(\hat{\rho}^{(B)})\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, we can even make this more explicit. We can decompose the matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C \in \mathbb{C}^{d^A \times d^B}\)</span> as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C = U S V^\dagger\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span> unitary matrices (of size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^A \times d^A\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^B \times d^B\)</span> respectively), and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^A \times d^B\)</span> matrix which only has nonzero entries
on the diagonal. Furthermore, the nonzero entries of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> can be chosen positive in descending
order. This decomposition is known as the <strong>singular value decomposition</strong>. For further reference,
we denote the diagonal elements of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i = S_{i,i}\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i=1,\ldots, \mathrm{min}(d^A,d^B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The unitary matrices <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span> can be interpreted as basis transforms in the subsystems
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> respectively, i.e. they define a new basis (which is thus specific to the chosen
state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span>), which we denote as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\psi^{(A)}_k}, k= 1,\ldots, d^A\}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\psi^{(B)}_l}, l= 1,\ldots, d^B\}\)</span>. We can then write</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split} \ket{\Psi} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{\min(d^A,d^B)} s_i \ket{\psi^A_i} \otimes \ket{\psi^B_i}\\
\hat{\rho}^{(A)} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{d^A} (s_i)^2 \ket{\psi^A_i} \bra{\psi^A_i}\\
\hat{\rho}^{(B)} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{d^b} (s_i)^2 \ket{\psi^B_i} \bra{\psi^B_i}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Hence, the reduced matrices appear immietely in diagonalised form. The singular values <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span>,
or rather their squares $p_i = (s_i)^2 are referred to as the <strong>entanglement spectrum</strong>. The
entanglement entropy is then given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ S = - \sum_{i} p_i \log(p_i)\]</div>
<p>In all of this, it is clear that subsystems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> were treated on equal footing, and it
does in fact not matter which of the two is chosen to probe the entanglement structure of
the state.</p>

### Suzuki-Trotter decomposition
So far, we have only discussed isolated quantum systems, the state of which corresponds to 
a vector (or a ray of vectors) in the Hilbert space. When the system is not isolated, it will
entangle with its environment. However, if we are not interested in any observables of the 
environment, we can still restrict to a description that only involves the system itself, at
the expense of modelling the state of the system as a mixed state or density matrix. 

discusse
Thermal expectation values are given by

$$\braket{\operator{O}} = \tr\left[\operator{O} \ec^{-\beta \ham}\right]/Z(\beta)= \tr\left[\ec^{-\beta \ham/2} \operator{O} \ec^{-\beta \ham/2}\right]/Z(\beta)$$

with the thermal partition function $Z(\beta)$ given by
$$Z(\beta) = \tr \ec^{-\beta \ham} = \sum_{s= \pm 1} \braket{s|\ec^{-\beta \ham}|s}.$$

The ground state physics is encoded in the limit $\beta \to \infty$. Note that, if the system has a unique ground state, we can obtain the ground state $\ket{\psi}$ of a quantum system by starting from essentially a random state $\ket{\phi}$ and evolving it in imaginary time $\tau = -\ic t$ for sufficiently long

$$\ket{\psi_0} \sim \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \ec^{-\tau \ham} \ket{\phi}$$

Expanding the initial state $\ket{\phi}$ in the energy eigenbasis of $\ham$, we see that the only condition is that it is not orthogonal to the ground state (subspace). In addition, the ground state will be well approximated if $\tau \Delta E \gg 1$, with $\Delta E=E_1 - E_0$ the energy gap.\footnote{This imaginary time evolution forms the basic ingredient of several numerical algorithms for approximating ground states of quantum many body systems, often in combination with the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition which is introduced below.} 
 This approach yields the following expression for the ground state expectation value of on operator $\operator{O}$
\begin{equation}
\braket{\operator{O}} = \lim_{\tau\to\infty} \braket{\phi|\ec^{-\tau \ham} \operator{O} \ec^{-\tau \ham}|\phi}/\braket{\phi|\ec^{-2\tau \ham} |\phi}\label{eq:imaginartimeexpval}
\end{equation}
This expression can be compared with Eq.~\eqref{eq:thermalexpval} with $\beta = 2\tau$; the only difference is in the boundary conditions.

For a quantum many body system, taking the exponential is as hard as determining the full diagonalisation of the hamiltonian, which is impossible due to the exponentially large Hilbert space. If the hamiltonian is a sum of local terms, each of these terms can be exponentiated easily, but for arbitrary $\tau$ there is no relation ship between $\exp(-\tau \sum_{i} \operator{h}_i)$ and the individual $\exp(-\tau \operator{h}_i)$, unless the different $\operator{h}_i$ commute. However, for an infinitesimal time step $\epsilon$, we can use to Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula (or better yet, the Zassenhaus formula) to obtain $\exp(-\epsilon \sum_{i} \operator{h}_i) = \prod_i \exp(-\epsilon \operator{h}_i) + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$. This then leads to the \emph{Suzuki-Trotter decomposition}
\begin{equation}
	\exp\left(-\tau \sum_{i} \operator{h}_i\right) = \lim_{M\to\infty} \left( \ec^{-\frac{\tau}{M} \sum_i \operator{h}_i} \right)^M =\lim_{M\to\infty} \left(\prod_i \ec^{-\frac{\tau}{M} \operator{h}_i} + \order(M^{-1})\right)^M 
\end{equation}
Note that splitting the time interval $[0,\tau]$ into small segments $\epsilon = \tau/M$ is also the starting point for deriving a path integral representation of the quantum partition function. The next step is to insert a resolution of the identity in between the $N$ different factors, where the labels of the basis will behave as classical degrees of freedom. For obtaining a path integral, the basis should be labeled by a number of continuous degrees of freedom, which can then become continuous functions of time in the limit $\epsilon\to 0$. Here, instead, we will keep $\epsilon$ small but finite, and use a discrete basis. 
\subsection{From quantum to statistical mechanics}
Let's start with a quantum system in $d=0$, i.e.\ a small number of spins, or in particular, a single spin, described by a hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
	\ham = - h_x \sigma^x - h_z \sigma^z
\end{equation}
While we could in principle exponentiate $\ham$ directly, we will treat it using the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. Throughout the remainder of this section, we will use the $\sz$ basis, which we denote as $\ket{1} = \ket{\uparrow}$ and $\ket{-1} = \ket{\downarrow}$. Inserting resolutions of the identity, we write
\begin{equation}
	Z(\beta) = \tr \ec^{-\beta \ham} = \sum_{\{s_k\}=\pm 1} \braket{s_1|\ec^{-\epsilon \ham}|s_2}\cdots \braket{s_M-1| \ec^{-\epsilon \ham}|s_{M}} \cdots \braket{s_M| \ec^{-\epsilon \ham}|s_{M+1}}
\end{equation}
with $s_{M+1} = s_1$, $M\epsilon =\beta$, and where
\begin{align*}
	\braket{s_{i}|\ec^{-\epsilon H}|s_{i+1}} &= \braket{s_{i}|\ec^{-\epsilon H}|s_{i+1}} \approx  \braket{s_{i}|\ec^{\epsilon h_z \sz}\ec^{\epsilon h_x \sx}|s_{i+1}}\\
	&=  \ec^{\epsilon h_z s_i} \braket{s_{i}|\cosh(\epsilon h_x) \one + \sinh(\epsilon h_x) \sx |s_{i+1}}\\
	&= \ec^{K s_{i}s_{i+1} + h s_i + f_0}.
\end{align*}
\begin{exercise}
Prove that the equality on the last line is obtained with , $K = -\frac{1}{2}\log \tanh(\epsilon h_x)$, $h = \epsilon h_z$ and $f_0 = \frac{1}{2}\log[\cosh(\epsilon h_x)\sinh(\epsilon h_x)]$.
\end{exercise}\\
We thus obtain $Z(\beta) = \sum_{s_k} \ec^{\sum_{i=1}^{M}K s_i s_{i+1} + h s_i}$, the partition function of the one-dimensional classical Ising model with periodic boundary conditions. Indeed, $\braket{s_{i}|\ec^{-\epsilon H}|s_{i+1}}$ does exactly correspond to the transfer matrix, and diagonalising the transfer matrix is the most straightforward approach to solving the one-dimensional classical Ising model. 

\subsection{Higher dimensional generalisation}

We now apply the same approach to the transverse field Ising model in $d$ dimensions, on a hypercubic lattice. We separate the hamiltonian in two parts according to
\begin{equation}
	\ham_{\text{TFIM}} = \left(-J\sum_{\braket{i,j}} \sz_i \sz_j  - h_z \sum_{i} \sz_i\right) + \left(- h_x \sum_{i} \sx_i\right)= \operator{H}_1 + \operator{H}_2
\end{equation}
Note that $\operator{H}_1$ and $\operator{H}_2$ in itself contain commuting terms, but of course don't mutually commute. We follow the same strategy, and will in every (imaginary) time step introduce a resolution of the identity using the tensor product $\sz$ basis. We now denote the basis at time step $k$ as $\ket{\{s_{i,k}\}}$, where $i$ labels a site in the $d$ dimensional lattice hosting the quantum degrees of freedom, and $k$ labels points along the imaginary time axis, which emerges as a new dimension in the problem. We find
\begin{align*}
\exp(-\epsilon \operator{H}_1)\ket{\{s_{i,k}\}} = \exp(\epsilon J \sum_{\braket{i,j}} s_{i,k} s_{j,k}+\epsilon h \sum_i s_{i,k}) \ket{\{s_{i,k}\}}
\end{align*}
as $\operator{H}_1$ is diagonal in this basis, and 
\begin{align*}
\braket{\{s_{i,k}\}|\exp(-\epsilon \operator{H}_2)|\{s_{i,k+1}\}} = \prod_i \braket{s_{i,k}|\ec^{-\epsilon h_x \sx_i} | s_{i,k+1}}
 \sim \exp(K_\perp\sum_{i} s_{i,k} s_{i,k+1})
\end{align*}
with $K_\perp = \log \tanh(\epsilon h_x)$ as before. Here, we have now ignored an overall proportionality factor, which is irrelevant when using the partition function to compute expectation values. With this, we find
\begin{equation}
	Z(\beta) = \sum_{\{s_i,k\}} \exp\left(\sum_{k=1}^{M}\sum_{i} K_\perp s_{i,k} s_{i,k+1}+\sum_{k=1}^M\sum_{\braket{i,j}} K_\parallel s_{i,k} s_{j,k} + \sum_{k=1}^{M}\sum_{i} h s_{i,k} \right)
\end{equation}
with $K_{\parallel} = \epsilon J$ and $h = \epsilon h_z$. We thus find the partition function of the classical Ising model in $d+1$ dimensions with anisotropic interaction strengths, periodic boundary condition in the imaginary time direction and a number of sites in the time direction given by $M = \beta/\epsilon$. Hence, the ground state regime $\beta\to \infty$ corresponds to the thermodynamic limit in this additional time direction of the corresponding classical system, and we will see that there are many similarities (or actually, equivalences) between between quantum phenomena in $d$ dimensions and classical phenomena in $D=d+1$ dimensions. On the other hand, when the quantum system is at finite temperature $\beta$, the additional dimension is finite and never in the thermodynamic limit. In that case, this extra dimension cannot cause new non-analyticities in the partition function and finite temperature quantum systems in $d$ dimensions are very similar to classical systems in $d$ dimensions.

In particular, the ground state of the quantum Ising chain has an extended symmetry broken
regime $g\in[0,1)$, matching the ferromagnetic phase at low temperatures in the
two-dimensional classical Ising model. One can show that also the order parameter between
the quantum chain and the classical model is equivalent. At finite temperature however, the
quantum Ising chain does not exhibit symmetry breaking, exactly like the one-dimensional
classical Ising model. It is not surprising that the $d=1$ quantum phase transition itself
is also completely equivalent to the $D=2$ finite temperature phase transition, which also
fits within the broader context of universality, which we briefly discuss in the next
section. The duality mapping in the quantum Ising chain is furthermore equivalent to the
well-known Kramers-Wannier duality in the classical Ising model.

This quantum to classical mapping can also be inverted.\footnote{This does not imply that
the mapping is unique. Choosing a different time step $\epsilon$ or a different basis, e.g.\
the $\sx$ instead of $\sz$ basis will result in a different classical model.} Taking a
codimension $1$ slice out of a $D$-dimensional classical partition function, one obtains a
transfer matrix which can be interpreted as the exponential of a quantum hamiltonian acting
on the Hilbert space of a $d=D-1$ dimensional quantum system. In fact, the modern
perspective on the exact solution of the two-dimensional classical Ising model by Onsager is
exactly by this transfer matrix approach, which is subsequently diagonalised using the
Jordan Wigner and free fermion approach from Section~\ref{s:isingexact}.

It is clear that the quantum to classical mapping is not specific to the quantum Ising model
and can be applied to any hamiltonian. The path integral representation of the partition
function fits within the same scheme, and only differs in the fact that the limit
$\epsilon\to 0$ is taken such that the additional dimension becomes continuous. This is
particularly natural if also the spatial dimensions of the quantum dimension are continuous,
i.e.\ if we have a quantum field theory. In this case, a $D=d+1$ dimensional classical
statistical field theory is obtained. For relativistic quantum field theories, where it is
common practice to explicitly count the time dimension together with the space dimensions,
imaginary time evolution leads to an action, which is equivalently a hamiltonian of a
classical field theory in $D=d+1$ spatial dimensions, with full Euclidean invariance.

One might thus wonder if there is anything new to be learned from studying quantum ground
states. First of all, there is one important catch which we have overlooked so far. There is
no guarantee that the above process yields a classical partition function with Boltzmann
weights which are positive, or even real. While this may seem like a technical detail, it is
of major importance. The quantum to classical mapping is the basis behind the Quantum Monte
Carlo method, one the most successful numerical methods for studying quantum many body
systems. One maps the quantum problem to a classical partition function and then uses one of
the many flavours of Monte Carlo sampling. However, with non-positive Boltzmann weights, the
interpretation of a probability distribution is lost and no efficient sampling procedure can
be designed, as samples might annihilate each other. This is known as the \emph{sign}
problem.

Secondly, for many non-relativistic quantum systems, the anisotropy between the imaginary
time direction and the spatial dimensions in the corresponding classical system cannot be
ignored, even at the critical point. In those cases, critical correlations behave
differently in the spatial and the time direction, which is characterised by a dynamical
critical exponent $z$. The case $z=1$ corresponds to the case where the critical point has
(emergent) rotation/Lorentz invariance between time and space.

A final reason to study quantum systems directly is that certain concepts are more natural
in that setting. In particular, the last 15 years, ideas from quantum information theory,
and in particular the concept of entanglement, have made their way into the standard toolbox
to study and characterize quantum many body systems.
