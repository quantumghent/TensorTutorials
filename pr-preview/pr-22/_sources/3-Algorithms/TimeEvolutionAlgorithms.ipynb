Another method (i)[TEBD](tebd) has already been explained in an earlier section. Following this we briefly explain how [imaginary time evolution](Imag_header) can be used to find ground states and how [thermal density matrices](FinTemp_header) can be simulated using MPS.\n",

One can in principle work out the above equation on the level of the $A$ matrices and try to solve the above equation. This gives a complicated set of (non-linear) equations that can be solved by one's favourite finite difference scheme, but requires the inversion of matrices with small singular values (and thus numerical instabilities) {cite}`haegeman2011time`, {cite}`HaegemanTDVP`.
