<h2><span class="section-number">1.1. </span>Quantum Mechanics and its Postulates<a class="headerlink" href="#quantum-mechanics-and-its-postulates" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>While the energy levels of the hydrogen atom played an important role in the historical
development of quantum mechanics, it became almost immediately clear that the true challenge
is in applying the laws of quantum mechanics to systems with many interacting particles or
fields. Note that the formalism of quantum mechanics, and in particular its postulates, are
generically valid and not restricted to the description of a single particle. Quantum field
theory also follows these postulates and is thus not a generalisation of quantum mechanics,
but rather a specific case of it. These postulates characterise the mathematical model by
which quantum mechanics describes physical systems, and more specifically how it represents
states, observables, measurements and dynamics. We briefly reiterate this postulates and
base our discussion on the wonderfull lecture notes “Quantum Information and Computation” by
John Preskill.</p>
<div class="section" id="postulate-1-states">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.1. </span><strong>Postulate 1: States</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#postulate-1-states" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The state of an isolated quantum system is associated to a ray of vectors in a complex
Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A Hilbert space is a metric complete inner product space. Let us unpack this definition:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> is a vector space in this case over the complex numbers. We will denote
elements of this vector space with Dirac’s ket notation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span>. In particular, we
can build linear combinations</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\psi} = a \ket{\psi_1} + b \ket{\psi_2}\]</div>
<p>for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a, b \in \mathbb{C}\)</span> and all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi_1}, \ket{\psi_2} \in \mathbb{H}\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> has an inner product, which maps to vecors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\varphi}\)</span>
onto a scalar <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\varphi|\psi} \in \mathbb{C}\)</span> with the properties of</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Linearity: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bra{\varphi} ( a \ket{\psi_1} + b \ket{\psi_2}) = a \braket{ \varphi | \psi_1} + b \braket{ \varphi | \psi_2}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Skew-symmetry: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{ \varphi | \psi} = \braket{ \psi | \varphi}^\ast\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Positivity: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{ \psi | \psi} \geq 0\)</span> with equality only if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi} = 0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This last property enables us to define a norm <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lVert \psi \rVert = \lVert \ket{\psi}
 \rVert = \sqrt{\braket{\psi|\psi}}\)</span>, which satisfies known properties such as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lVert \psi
 \rVert = 0 \Leftrightarrow \ket{\psi} = 0\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lVert a \ket{\psi} \rVert = \vert a\vert
 \lVert \psi \rVert\)</span> and the triangle inequality <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lVert \ket{\varphi} + \ket{\psi} \rVert
 \leq \lVert \varphi \rVert + \lVert \psi \rVert\)</span>.</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="3">
<li><p>The final property of metric completeness is a technical requirement that is only
relevant in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Firstly, a metric is a notation of
distance between the elements in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>, which is provided by the norm of the
difference, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d(\varphi, \psi) = \lVert \varphi - \psi \rVert\)</span>.</p>
<p>Completeness of the metric is a specific property that guarantees that certain sequences
of vectors are guaranteed to have a limit value that also exists in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>. This
is necessary to make sense of e.g. Fourier series.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The state of a quantum system is associated to a ray of vectors, which is the
one-dimensional space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ a \ket{\psi} , \forall a \in \mathbb{C}\}\)</span> spanned by a single
(nonzero) vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi} \in \mathbb{H}\)</span>. We will describe the state of the system using
a single representative <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> of this ray, which we typically choose such that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{ \psi | \psi} = 1\)</span>. However, this does not fix the representative completely, as we
can still add arbitrary phases <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\exp(\mathrm{i}\alpha)\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\alpha} \ket{\psi}\)</span> describe the same state.</p>
<p>The best known Hilbert space from your courses on single-particle quantum mechanics is
probably <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)\)</span>, the Hilbert space for a single quantum particle moving in the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>-dimensional coordinate space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> (typically <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=1,2,3\)</span>). This Hilbert space
corresponds to the space of all square-integrable functions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi:\mathbb{R}^d \to
\mathbb{C}: x \mapsto \psi(x)\)</span> and the inner product is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{\varphi | \psi} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \varphi(x)^\ast \psi(x)\,\mathrm{d} x\]</div>
<p>However, this is already a complicated Hilbert space from a technical perspective. Hilbert
spaces can also be finite-dimensional, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{C}^d\)</span>, the space of column vectors of
length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>, with the standard Euclidean inner product</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{\varphi | \psi} = \sum_{i=1}^d \varphi_i^\ast \psi_i\]</div>
<p>These Hilbert spaces will be very important in our discussion. The simplest nontrivial case
corresponds to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d=2\)</span> and the associated quantum system is known under various names. It is
often referred to as a qubit in the context of quantum information theory. There are various
ways in which qubits can be physically realised. Another common example of a two-dimensional
Hilbert space is for describing the spin degree of freedom of an electron, or another
particle with spin quantum number 1/2. Such a reduced description (forgetting about the
position) is possible if the electron is localised in space, for example when it is strongly
bound to an atom.</p>
<p>If we do want to describe a particle that moves in space, we might also consider it to exist
only at discrete positions in space, i.e. on a lattice. For example, on a one-dimensional
lattice (a.k.a. a chain) with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> sites, the Hilbert space would also correspond to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{C}^L\)</span> and the standard basis vectors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vert j \rangle, j=1,\dots,L\)</span>
correspond to the state of the system if the particle is exactly localised on site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>. We
can also consider infinitely large lattices, e.g. the one-dimensional chain where there is a
site associated with every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> (or the n-dimensional hypercubic lattice
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{Z}^n\)</span>). The resulting Hilbert space is then spanned by the states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vert j \rangle\)</span>
for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, and is thus infinite-dimensional but with a straightforward
countably infinite basis.</p>
<p>Of course, our goal is to find the Hilbert space of a many body system. We return to this
question below and devote a complete section to it.</p>

<p>Physical observables of the system correspond to self-adjoint (a.k.a. Hermitian) linear
operators on the Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>.</p>
<p>An operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span> on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> is a linear map <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}:\mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{H}\)</span>,
i.e. a map from vectors to vectors that satisfies</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{A}( a \ket{\varphi} + b \lvert \psi \rangle) = a \hat{A}(\ket{\varphi}) + b
\hat{A}(\ket{\psi})\]</div>
<p>The adjoint of an operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span> is a new operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}^\dagger\)</span> that is constructed
such that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\bra{\varphi} \hat{A} \psi \rangle = \langle \hat{A}^\dagger \varphi \ket{\psi}\]</div>
<p>for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\varphi}, \ket{\psi} \in \mathbb{H}\)</span> and where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vert \hat{A}\psi \rangle =
\hat{A} \ket{\psi}\)</span>. This definition requires that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((a_1 \hat{A}_1 + a_2 \hat{A}_2)^\dagger
= a_1^\ast \hat{A}_1^\dagger + a_2^\ast \hat{A}_2^\dagger\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\hat{A}_1
\hat{A}_2)^\dagger = \hat{A}_2^\dagger \hat{A}_1^\dagger\)</span>.</p>
<p>A self-adjoint operator is an operator such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}^\dagger = \hat{A}\)</span> or thus</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{\varphi | \hat{A} \psi } = \braket{ \hat{A}^\dagger \varphi | \psi}\]</div>
<p>for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\varphi}, \ket{\psi} \in \mathbb{H}\)</span>. Linear combinations of self-adjoint
operators with real coefficients are self-adjoint. The composition of two self-adjoint
linear operators <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}_1 \hat{A}_2\)</span> is self-adjoint if and only if</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\left[ \hat{A}_1 , \hat{A}_2 \right] = \hat{A}_1 \hat{A}_2 - \hat{A}_2 \hat{A}_1 = 0,\]</div>
<p>i.e. if the operators also commute. Self-adjoint operators have real eigenvalues, and
eigenvectors associated to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. In a finite-dimensional
Hilbert space, self-adjoint operators admit a spectral decomposition</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{A} = \sum_{n} \lambda_n \hat{P}_n\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}_n\)</span> is the spectral projector onto the eigenspace associated with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span>.
The spectral projectors satisfy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}_n \hat{P}_m = \delta_{n,m} \hat{P}_n\)</span>,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}_n^\dagger = \hat{P}_n\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{n} \hat{P}_n = \mathbb{1}\)</span>, the identity
operator. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> has one-dimensional eigenspace spanned by the eigenvector
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vert\phi_n\rangle\)</span>, then</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{P}_n = \frac{\vert \phi_n \rangle \langle \phi_n \vert}{\langle \phi_n \vert \phi_n \rangle}\]</div>
<p>where the denominator can be omitted if the eigenvector is normalised.</p>
<p>In the language of matrices, these properties can be rephrased as follows: With respect to
an orthonormal basis choice, self-adjoint operators are represented as hermitian matrices.
Such matrices can be diagonalised by a unitary transformation, or thus, we can construct a
complete basis consisting of eigenvectors. With respect to this basis, the self-adjoint
operator is represented by a diagonal matrix with real values on the diagonal.</p>

<p>Given an observable to which we associate the operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span>, we now need to prescribe
the result of measuring this observable with respect to a system that is in a state
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span>. The most compact way of describing the result is by stating that, the
expectation value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\hat{A}}\)</span> (= the mean value of the measurement when averaging
over an ensemble of identical copies of the system) is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{\hat{A}} = \frac{\braket{\psi \vert \hat{A} \vert \psi}}{\braket{\psi \vert \psi}}\]</div>
<p>By exploiting the fact that this also prescribes the expectation value of all higher moments
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\hat{A}^k}\)</span>, this determines the full probability distribution of the measurement
outcome, and yields the more familiar result: The only possible measurement outcomes are
given by the eigenvalues <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span>, and for a system in state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span>
(now assumed normalized), the probability of obtaining <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> is given by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n =
\braket{\psi \vert \hat{P}_n \vert \psi}\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}_n\)</span> the spectral projector from
above. In the case that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> has a single (linearly independent) eigenvector
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\phi_n}\)</span> (also assumed normalised), this amounts to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n = \vert
\braket{\phi_n|\psi}\vert^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is a second part to the measurement postulate, which states that, if the measurement
is immediately repeated (without intermediate dynamics, as described by the next postulate),
then the same measurement outcome is obtained. Because the measurement outcome with respect
to the initial state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> is probabilistic and can yield different results, this
requires that after the first measurement, the state changes is changed. This is the
well-known <strong>collapse</strong> of the wave function. More specifically, if a measurement of
observable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span> is performed in a system with state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> and the measurement
value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> is obtained, then the state of the system changes to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\psi} \longrightarrow \frac{\hat{P}_n \ket{\psi}}{\lVert \hat{P}_n \ket{\psi}\rVert}.\]</div>
<p>Note that the denominator cannot vanish, as otherwise the probability of having obtained
measurement outcome <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_n\)</span> would have been zero in the first place.</p>

<p>All of the previous axioms remain valid for a composite system consisting of several quantum
degrees of freedom. However, we need to know how to describe the state of the system, and
thus more specifically, how to define the Hilbert space associated to such a system. It
turns out that quantum mechanics forces us to distinguish two cases.</p>
<div class="section" id="distinguisable-particles-and-tensor-products">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.1. </span>Distinguisable Particles and Tensor Products<a class="headerlink" href="#distinguisable-particles-and-tensor-products" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider a quantum system composed out of two subsystems, which we call <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>,
sometimes referred to as Alice and Bob in quantum information context. These can themselves
already be many-body systems. Suppose we know the Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A\)</span> in which to
describe states of subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> when considered as an isolated system on itself, and
analoguously for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^B\)</span>. Now consider both systems together, but where they do not
interact, so that we can still treat them independently. In particular, we can prepare
subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> in a state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^A}\)</span> and subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> in a state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^B}\)</span>. We
should also be able to describe these two independent subsystems jointly, so that there must
exist a map from the two arguments <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\ket{\psi^A}, \ket{\varphi^B}) \in \mathbb{H}^A \times
\mathbb{H}^B\)</span> to a single state which we denote as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{ \psi^A} \otimes \ket{\varphi^B}\)</span>
and that lives in a joint Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{AB}\)</span> that we have yet to determine.</p>
<p>Now, it makes sense that, if we build superpositions in one of the two subsystems, while
keeping the other fixed, this also correspond to a superposition in the joint description of
both systems together. This leads to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\left (a_1 \ket{\psi^A_1} + a_2 \ket{\psi^A_2}\right) \otimes \ket{\varphi^B} = a_1
\ket{\psi^A_1 }\otimes \ket{\varphi^B} + a_2 \ket{\psi^A_1 }\otimes \ket{\varphi^B}\]</div>
<p>and similarly</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\psi^A} \otimes \left(b_1 \ket{\varphi^B_1} + b_2 \ket{\varphi^A_2}\right) = b_1
\ket{\psi^A }\otimes \ket{\varphi^B_1} + b_2 \ket{\psi^A }\otimes \ket{\varphi^B_2}.\]</div>
<p>Hence, the Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{AB}\)</span> that we are trying to construct must contain all
states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^A} \otimes \ket{\varphi^B}\)</span> for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^A} \in \mathbb{H}^A\)</span> and
all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\varphi^B} \in \mathbb{H}^B\)</span>, all possible linear combinations thereof (in order
to be a vector space), but in such a way that the above equalities hold. This construction,
which can be made mathematically precise, is known as the tensor product of vector spaces
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{AB} = \mathbb{H}^A \otimes \mathbb{H}^B\)</span>.</p>
<p>We have also denoted the output of the map from two states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\ket{\psi^A}, \ket{\varphi^B})
\in \mathbb{H}^A \times \mathbb{H}^B\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A \otimes \mathbb{H}^B\)</span> using the same
tensor product symbol, and refer to such a state as a (tensor) product state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{ \psi^A}
\otimes \ket{\varphi^B}\)</span>. Importantly, however, the tensor product space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A
\otimes \mathbb{H}^B\)</span> certainly contains vectors which are not product states, such as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[a_1 \ket{ \psi_1^A} \otimes \ket{\varphi_1^B} + a_2 \ket{ \psi_2^A} \otimes
\ket{\varphi_2^B}.\]</div>
<p>This forms the basis for quantum correlations and the concept of (quantum) entanglement,
which will be a fundamental property of quantum many-body systems. That the Hilbert space of
a composite system is given by the tensor product of the individual Hilbert spaces is often
introduced as a separate axiom. The deductive (but informal) argument just given can however
be turned into a proof that depends only on the axioms given above (in fact only on the
first two).</p>
<p>As expected (and required), it can be shown that the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces is
again a Hilbert space, if we define its inner product in the following way. We first define
the inner product for product states as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{\psi_1^A \otimes \varphi_1^B | \psi_2^A \otimes \varphi_2^B } = \braket{\psi_1^A |
\psi_2^A} \braket{\varphi_1^B | \varphi_2^B}\]</div>
<p>and then extend this definition by linearity (in the second argument and antilinearity in
the first argument).</p>
<p>In practice, given two finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A \cong
\mathbb{C}^{d^A}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^B \cong \mathbb{C}^{d^B}\)</span> with a basis <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ \ket{j},
j=1,\dots, d^A\}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{k}, k=1,\dots, d^B\}\)</span>, the tensor product space is spanned by
a basis composed of all products</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\{ \ket{j,k} = \ket{j} \otimes \ket{k}, j=1,\dots, d^A, k=1,\dots, d^B\}\]</div>
<p>and thus has dimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^A \cdot d^B\)</span>. A general state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi} \in
\mathbb{H}^{A}\otimes \mathbb{H}^B\)</span> can then be expanded as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\Psi} = \sum_{j=1}^{d^A }\sum_{k=1}^{d^B} \Psi_{jk} \ket{j,k}\]</div>
<p>The expansion coefficients <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Psi_{jk}\)</span> thus have two indices, and it is often useful to
think of them as a matrix. Note that we will almost always use this product basis, also
referred to as the <em>computational basis</em>, for working with tensor product spaces. However,
one can certainly also use more complicated basis choices, where the basis vectors are not
simple product states. One well known choice that you might remember from your quantum
mechanics course is in the case of two spin-1/2 systems. If we denote the basis for a single
spin-1/2 system as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\uparrow},\ket{\downarrow}\}\)</span>, then the product basis for a
system consisting of two spin-1/2 systems is given by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\uparrow,\uparrow},
\ket{\downarrow,\uparrow}, \ket{\uparrow,\downarrow}, \ket{\downarrow,\downarrow}, \}\)</span>.
However, in the context of spin coupling (see Section on Symmetries), one also uses the
coupled basis</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\ket{0,0} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{\uparrow,\downarrow} - \ket{\downarrow,\uparrow}\right)\\
\ket{1,+1} &amp;= \ket{\uparrow,\uparrow}\\
\ket{1,0} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{\uparrow,\downarrow} + \ket{\downarrow,\uparrow}\right)\\
\ket{1,-1} &amp;= \ket{\downarrow,\downarrow}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Note that we also use the same tensor product notation as an operation to map operators from
the subsystems into operators acting on the full tensor product Hilbert space. In
particular, the process of measuring operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span> in subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and simultaneously
operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{B}\)</span> in subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> is associated with an operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\otimes \hat{B}\)</span>
acting on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A \otimes \mathbb{H}^B\)</span>, the action of which is first defined on the
product states as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\left(\hat{A} \otimes \hat{B}\right) \left(\ket{\psi^A}\otimes \ket{\varphi^B}\right) = \left(\hat{A}\ket{\psi^A}\right) \otimes \left(\hat{B}\ket{\varphi^B}\right)\]</div>
<p>and then extended by linearity. It furthermore holds that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[(\hat{A}_1 \otimes \hat{B}_1) (\hat{A}_2 \otimes \hat{B}_2) = (\hat{A}_1 \hat{A}_2) \otimes (\hat{B}_1 \hat{B}_2).\]</div>
<p>With respect to a product basis, the matrix representation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(\hat{A} \otimes
\hat{B}\right)\)</span> is given by the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product">Kronecker product</a>.</p>
<p>When we are only interested in an operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{O}\)</span> acting on subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> without doing
anything on subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, we should create the operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{O} \otimes \hat{1}_B\)</span>, with
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{1}_B\)</span> the identity operator of the Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^B\)</span>. Often, we will omit
this explicit tensor product with the identity operator, and simply use some notation which
indicates that an operator acts on a certain subsystem, such as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{O}^{(A)} = \hat{O}
\otimes \hat{1}_B\)</span>. This also makes it explicit that operators defined on different
subsystems, when lifted to act on the full Hilbert space, commute, i.e.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\left[\hat{O}_1^{(A)} , \hat{O}_2^{(B)}\right] =
\left[ \hat{O}_1 \otimes \hat{1}_B, \hat{1}_A \otimes \hat{O}_2\right] = 0.\]</div>
<p>The tensor product construction extends readily to systems with multiple subsystems.
Consider for example a system consisting of qubits, where every individual qubit has an
associated Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{C}^2\)</span> with basis denoted as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}\)</span>. The
Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^N\)</span> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> qubits is then spanned by a computational basis which we
can denote as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\{\ket{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N} = \ket{s_1} \otimes \ket{s_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes
\ket{s_N}; s_1 =0,1; s_2 =0,1; \ldots; s_n =0,1\}.\]</div>
<p>Hence, the Hilbert space thus has dimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^N\)</span>, and a general state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span> has
expansion coefficients</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Psi_{s_1,s_2, \ldots, s_N}\]</div>
<p>which can be interpreted as a single vector of length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^N\)</span>, or as a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>-dimensional tensor,
where every tensor index ranges over the two values 0 and 1. This exponential increase of
the Hilbert space dimension with the number of particles is exactly why the quantum
many-body problem is so difficult, but also essential for providing a quantum computer with
its speed-up. It is exactly these type of quantum states living in a many-body Hilbert
space, which is thus composed of many tensor product factors, that we will represent as a
tensor network.</p>
<p>Finally, we also have to specify the Hamiltonian of a many-body system. It typically takes
the form of a sum of terms, where every individual term acts nontrivially on only a few
subsystems. One important example that will reappear throughout these tutorials is the
“Quantum Ising Model with transverse magnetic field”, which acts on a system composed of
qubits or spin-1/2 particles, and is defined as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{H} = - J \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} \sigma^z_i \otimes \sigma^z_j - h \sum_i
\sigma^x_i\]</div>
<p>Here, the summation variables <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> correspond to the sites of a lattice. The notation
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}\)</span> denotes a sum over pairs of neighbouring lattice sites <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>. The second sum contains terms <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma^x_i\)</span> which act nontrivially only on the site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>,
and as the identity operator elsewhere. If, for example, we enumerate the sites from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>, it would act as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\sigma^x_i = \underbrace{1 \otimes 1 \otimes \ldots \otimes 1}_{\text{$i-1$ factors}} \otimes \sigma^x \otimes \underbrace{1 \otimes \ldots \otimes 1}_{\text{$N-i-1$ factors}}\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma^x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}\)</span> the Pauli x matrix, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>
the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 x 2\)</span> unit matrix. The first set of terms in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}\)</span> acts nontrivially on two sites,
and is defined analoguously, using the Pauli z matrices <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma^z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The tensor product construction needs to be revised when discussing the Hilbert space of a
system composed of identical particles. Consider for example a system made out of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>
identical particles. To every individual particle we can associate a particular Hilbert
space, which we denote as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\)</span>, for example <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)} =
L^2(\mathbb{R})\)</span> for a particle moving on the real line, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)} =
\mathbb{C}^L\)</span> for a particle living on the sites of a chain of length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we temporarily assign each of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> particles a label <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=1, \dots, N\)</span>, then the Hilbert

<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\widetilde{\mathbb{H}}^{(N)} = \left(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\right)^{\otimes N}\)</span>. However, for
identical particles, our labeling is completely arbitrary. For the case of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=2\)</span> particles
on a chain of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> sites, we cannot distinguish between the state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j_1, j_2}\)</span> where
particle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> is on site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_1\)</span> and particle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\)</span> is on site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_2\)</span> versus the state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j_2,
j_1}\)</span> where site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_1\)</span> is occupied by the particle that we gave label <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\)</span> and site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_2\)</span> is
occupied by the particle with label <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>. A general redefinition of the particle labels
amounts to a permutation, and we have to require that no physical measurement can
distinguish between such permutations. Hence, this permutation invariance does not behave
like a regular symmetry (like e.g. rotation symmetry, one can still construct observables
along preferred directions such that they can detect rotations).</p>
<p>We are forced to restrict our tensor product Hilbert space
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\right)^{\otimes N}\)</span> to the subspace <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(N)}\)</span> of physical
states which are not affected by acting with such permutations. Note that, due to the fact
that quantum states actually correspond to rays of vectors, it is still allowed that the
vectors in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(N)}\)</span> pick up a phase factor when applying certain permutations. It
is a result in the representation theory of the permutation group that there are only two
possibilities. Either the phase factor is always absent (or thus 1), or the phase factor is
(-1) for odd permutations and (+1) for even permutations, i.e. the phase factor equals the
sign(ature) of the permutation. Identical particles for which the phase factor is always one
are known as <em>bosons</em>, whereas those with the nontrival phase factor choice correspond to
<em>fermions</em>. Indeed, the nontrivial phase factor automatically gives rise to <em>Pauli’s
exclusion principle</em>: two fermions cannot be in the same quantum state, since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{12}
\ket{j_1,j_2} = \ket{j_2,j_1} = -\ket{j_1,j_2}\)</span> and for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_1=j_2\)</span> we would thus find
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j,j} = -\ket{j,j}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Bosons are thus described by states which are symmetric under permutations, whereas fermions
are described by states which are called antisymmetric. We can define an operator on
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde{\mathbb{H}}^{(N)} = \left(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\right)^{\otimes N}\)</span> that maps any given
state onto such a (anti)symmeric state, namely by first defining its action on product
states as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{S}^{\pm} \ket{\psi_1} \otimes \ket{\psi_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{\psi_N} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{\sigma \in S_N} \epsilon_\sigma \ket{\psi_{\sigma(1)}} \otimes
\ket{\psi_{\sigma(2)}} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{\psi_{\sigma(N)}}\]</div>
<p>and then extending it by linearity. Here, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_N\)</span> is the symmetric group containing all
permutations <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> elements, where the permutation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> is a bijective map
from integers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j \in \{1,\dots,N\}\)</span> to a new number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma(j) \in \{1,\dots,N\}\)</span>. The
sign(ature) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon_\sigma\)</span> of the permutation takes the value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+1\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-1\)</span>, depending on
whether the permutation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> can be obtained by composing an even or odd number of
elementary transpositions. An elementary transposition <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau_{i,j}\)</span> is a permutation which
only interchanges the two numbers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j \neq i\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\tau_{i,j}(i) =j, \tau_{i,j}(j) = i, \tau_{i,j}(k) =k, \forall k\neq i \land k \neq j\]</div>
<p>Note that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{\pm}\)</span> does not necessarily yield a normalised state, and can indeed even
map a state to zero, in order to give rise to Pauli’s exclusion principle:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^-\ket{j,j} = 0\)</span>. The image of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{\pm}\)</span> contains all states with the proper
behaviour under relabeling permutations, and thus correspond to the physical Hilbert space
for bosons or fermions:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbb{H}^{(N)} = \hat{S}^{\pm} \widetilde{\mathbb{H}}^{(N)} = \hat{S}^{\pm} \left(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\right)^{\otimes N}\]</div>
<p>Note that in this case, the physical Hilbert space is not a tensor product. However, we can
think of it as a subspace of an auxiliary Hilbert space, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \widetilde{\mathbb{H}}^{(N)}\)</span>,
which is a tensor product. The restriction to this subspace can thus be thought of as a
constraint, and the same scenario happens in other constrained quantum systems. The most
notable example is that of quantum gauge theories, where there is an extensive set of
constraints, namely that physical quantum states need to be gauge invariant.</p>
<p>Now consider a single particle Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\)</span> with an orthonormal basis
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{j}, j=1,\ldots,L\}\)</span>, for example where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j}\)</span> corresponds to the particle being
positioned on site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> of a lattice with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> sites. We also refer to these single particle
states as modes. To construct a basis for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(N)}\)</span>, we can start from the tensor
product basis of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\widetilde{\mathbb{H}}^{(N)}\)</span> and apply <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{\pm}\)</span> to each of its
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L^N\)</span> elements. Let us henceforth denote these states as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{j_1,j_2,\ldots ,j_N} = \hat{S}^{\pm} \left(\ket{j_1} \otimes \ket{j_2} \otimes \cdots
\otimes \ket{j_N}\right)\]</div>
<p>The application of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{\pm}\)</span> will create certain linear dependences. In particular,
states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \ket{j_1,j_2, \ldots, j_N}\)</span> that contain the same set of modes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span>, i.e. for
which the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span>’s are related by a permutation, are equal (up to a sign in the case of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^-\)</span>). We can thus select a single state by ordering the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span> arguments.
Furthermore, in the case of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{-}\)</span>, the state is mapped to zero as soon as two <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span>
values coincide, so we can eliminate such states. If we thus restrict the set to states
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j_1,j_2,\ldots ,j_N}\)</span> which are such that the modes are ordered as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_1 &lt; j_2 &lt; \ldots
&lt; j_N\)</span> (for fermions) or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_1 \leq j_2 \leq \ldots \leq j_N\)</span> (for bosons), then we have a
linearly independent set of states. For fermions, this implies in particular that we need to
have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N \leq L\)</span>, there cannot be more fermions in the system then there are linearly
independent modes (single particle states).</p>
<p>Finally, one can wonder about the normalisation of these states. For fermions, the
superposition created by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^-\)</span> contains <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N!\)</span> terms, which are mutually orthogonal, so
that the resulting state is normalised, because of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\sqrt{N!}\)</span> prefactor in the
definition of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^{-}\)</span>. More generally, one then finds</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; i_N | j_1 &lt; j_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; j_N} = \delta_{i_1,j_1}
\delta_{i_2,j_2} \cdots \delta_{i_N,j_N}\]</div>
<p>For bosons, the situation is more complicated in the case that some <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span> values coincide.
Some of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N!\)</span> terms created by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^+\)</span> are then equal and contribute differently to
the norm. If we denote with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L\)</span> the number of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> values that equal the
value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1, 2, \ldots, L\)</span>, i.e. the number of particles in mode <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1, 2, \ldots, L\)</span>, then we
find</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{i_1 \leq i_2 \leq \ldots \leq i_N | j_1 \leq j_2 \leq \ldots \leq j_N} = (n_1! n_2!
\cdots n_L!) \delta_{i_1,j_1} \delta_{i_2,j_2} \cdots \delta_{i_N,j_N}\]</div>
<p>This more general exprression is also valid for fermions, where every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j\)</span> is restricted to
be zero or one. In fact, the values <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j=1,\ldots,L\)</span> completely characterise the
state, and can thus be used to relabel the basis. Instead of specifying the mode <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j_k\)</span> that
each particle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k=1,\ldots,N\)</span> occupies (where the labeling of the particles is arbitrary
because they are identical), we can move to a mode-based description and thus specify the
number of particles in each mode, also known as the mode occupation number. We can then
refer to the basis vectors as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j = 0, 1\)</span> (fermions) or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j = 0,1,2, \ldots \)</span> (bosons) and furthermore
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{j=1}^{L} n_j = N\)</span>. Furthermore, we define these states to be normalised to 1, i.e. we
absorb a suitable normalisation factor when defining <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L}\)</span> in terms
of the construction above.</p>
<p>This way of labelling the basis states now is again reminiscent of a tensor product
structure, i.e. we could think of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L}\)</span> as the tensor product of
states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{n_j}\)</span> associated to every mode, and where the Hilbert space associated with
such a mode is two-dimensional in the case of fermions, or infinite-dimensional in the case
of bosons. However, there is still a global constraint <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{j=1}^{L} n_j = N\)</span> so that we
cannot let the different <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j\)</span> values vary completely independently from each other.
Furthermore, some caution is now needed as to what it means to have operators acting on
these different “mode Hilbert spaces”. The correct formalism is that of second quantisation,
which we introduce next.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In many applications, people do still work with the framework of first quantisation, and
consider <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>-particle states constructed by symmetrising or antisymmetrising the tensor
product of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> single-particle states, in a so-called independent particle model or
approximation. Such states are quite cumbersome to work with. As can already be seen, the
antisymmetric case is slightly easier and is known as a Slater determinant. Indeed, the
antisymmetrisation formula is reminiscent of the Leibniz formula of a determinant, and for
example the inner product between two Slater determinants constructed from
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\psi_n},n=1,\ldots,N\}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\varphi_n},n=1,\ldots,N\}\)</span> is given by the
determinant of the matrix containing all overlaps <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\varphi_m \vert \psi_n}\)</span>. Slater
determinants form the basis of Hartree-Fock theory for approximating the state of electrons
in an atom or molecule.</p>
<p>The bosonic version occurs in the context of Bose-Einstein condensation and cold atom
systems more generally. In that case, the inner product between two such states gives rise
to a determinant-like formula, but without the minus signs. This construction is known as
the permenant, but unlike the determinant it is very hard to compute in general and really
requires to explicitly sum up all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N!\)</span> terms.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.3. </span>Fock Space and Second Quantisation<a class="headerlink" href="#fock-space-and-second-quantisation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When working with basis vectors using the occuppation number representation, we might
consider dropping the overall constraint <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{j=1}^L n_j = N\)</span>. This amounts to working in
a larger Hilbert space, which is known as the Fock space, and consists of the direct sum of
all physical (symmetrised or antisymmetrised) Hilbert spaces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(N)}\)</span> for
different particle numbers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>, going all the way from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=0\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbb{H} = \bigoplus_{N=0}^{+\infty} \mathbb{H}^{(N)}\]</div>
<p>In the case of fermions and with a finite-dimensional single-particle Hilbert space
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)} \cong \mathbb{C}^L\)</span>, the upper limit in the direct sum is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=L\)</span>, i.e.
there are no states with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N &gt; L\)</span> and so the associated Hilbert spaces are zero-dimensional.
This direct sum furthermore also contains the case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=0\)</span>, which we have not discussed
before. In the previous subsection we started the construction of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(N)}\)</span> from a
given single particle Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\)</span>. When there are no particles in the
system, there is only a single state in which it can be, corresponding to having all
occupation numbers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_j = 0\)</span> for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>. Hence, for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=0\)</span> particles, the Hilbert space
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(0)}\)</span> is spanned by a single state, which we typically denote as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Omega}=\ket{0,0,\dots,0}\)</span> and refer to as the <em>vacuum state</em>. Note that this vacuum
state is normalised, and is thus very different from an actual zero vector of the vector
space, which has norm zero.</p>
<p>The Fock space becomes a Hilbert space simply by incorporating the inner product from each
of its summands. States within the different summands of this direct sum are defined to be
orthogonal, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\varphi^{(M)} \vert \psi^{(N)}}=0\)</span> for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span>-particle states
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\varphi^{(M)}}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>-particle states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^{(N)}}\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M \neq N\)</span>.</p>
<p>The main benefits of using the formalism of second quantisation are not about losing the
overall particle number constraint, but for working with operators, in particular to
describe (interacting) Hamiltonians. In first quantisation, we need to specify a Hamiltonian
given a particular number of particles, i.e.\ the number of particles is an external
parameter of the system. Using the Fock space, we can now define operators in such a way
that their action is immediately defined for states with an arbitrary number of particles,
including even states which are superpositions over different particle numbers.</p>
<p>Hereto, we first introduce operators that enable us to connect the different particle number
sectors, by creating (adding) or annihilating (removing) particles in the system. In
particular, we denote with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{a}_j^+\)</span> the operator that adds a new particle in the mode
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> in the system and with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{a}_j^-\)</span> the operator that removes a particle that is in
mode <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> from the system. As it turns out that both operators are related via the adjoint,
i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\Phi| \hat{a}_j^+ \Psi} = \braket{\hat{a}_j^- \Phi | \Psi}\)</span>, we use the
simpler notation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{a}_j\)</span> for the <em>annihilation operator</em> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{a}_j^\dagger\)</span> for the
<em>creation operator</em>. To construct these operators in a mathematically precise and
constructive way is actually somewhat tedious (but see
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_quantization#Creation_and_annihilation_operators">Wikipedia</a>).
We just summarize their main properties. In particular, we want to have the property that
the (anti)symmetrized states satisfy</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{j_1,j_2, \ldots, j_N} = \hat{a}_{j_1}^\dagger \hat{a}_{j_2}^\dagger \cdots
\hat{a}_{j_N}^\dagger\ket{\Omega}.\]</div>
<p>It is immediately clear that, because of the (anti)symmetry, this requires that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[[\hat{a}_i^\dagger, \hat{a}_j^\dagger] = 0\ (\text{bosons})\quad\text{or}\quad
\{\hat{a}_i^\dagger,\hat{a}_j^\dagger\} = 0\ (\text{fermions}).\]</div>
<p>From the normalisation of these states, it also follows that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[[\hat{a}_i, \hat{a}_j^\dagger] = \delta_{i,j}\ (\text{bosons})\quad\text{or}\quad
\{\hat{a}_i,\hat{a}_j^\dagger\} = \delta_{i,j}\ (\text{fermions}).\]</div>
<p>With respect to the normalized basis vectors, using the occupation representation, we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_L!}}
(\hat{a}_1^\dagger)^{n_1} (\hat{a}_2^\dagger)^{n_2} \cdots (\hat{a}_L^\dagger)^{n_L}
\ket{\Omega}\]</div>
<p>which can be summarized using</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{align}
\hat{a}_j \ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_j, \ldots, n_L} &amp;= (\pm 1)^{n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_{j-1}} \sqrt{n_j} \ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_j - 1, \ldots, n_L},\\
\hat{a}_j^\dagger \ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_j, \ldots, n_L} &amp;= (\pm 1)^{n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_{j-1}} \sqrt{n_j+1} \ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_j + 1, \ldots, n_L}.
\end{align}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>It then follows easily that the operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{n}_j = \hat{a}_j^\dagger \hat{a}_j\)</span> satisfies</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{n}_j \ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_j, \ldots, n_L} = n_j \ket{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_j, \ldots, n_L}\]</div>
<p>and thus measures the number of particles in mode <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>. The operators <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{n}_j\)</span> are
referred to as <em>number operators</em>. The total number of particles can then be measured using</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{N} = \sum_{j=1}^{L} \hat{n}_j\]</div>
<p>but the Fock space does of course contain states which are superpositions over different
particle numbers (and which are thus not eigenstates of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{N}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, by studying how single particle states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j} \equiv \hat{a}_j^\dagger
\ket{\Omega}\)</span> change under a change of single particle basis, or thus, a transformation to a
new set of modes, we can deduce how the associated creation and annihilation operators
transform. Suppose we have a different single-particle basis, which for clarity we label
with greek letters <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa = 1,\ldots,L\)</span>. We then find</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\kappa} = \hat{a}_\kappa^\dagger \ket{\Omega} = \sum_{j} \ket{j} \braket{j\vert\kappa}
= \sum_{j} \braket{j\vert \kappa} \hat{a}_j^\dagger \ket{\Omega}\]</div>
<p>from which we obtain</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{a}_\kappa^\dagger = \sum_{j} \braket{j\vert \kappa} \hat{a}_j^\dagger,
\qquad\hat{a}_\kappa = \sum_{j} \braket{\kappa\vert j} \hat{a}_j.\]</div>
<p>Note that the transformation matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{j \vert \kappa}\)</span> between two orthonormal bases
correspond to a unitary matrix. These transformation rules will be employed often, for
example, to switch between a position and momentum space representation.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The bosonic creation and annihilation operators are of course reminiscent from the operators
introduced for diagonalising the single particle harmonic oscillator model. Indeed, out of
the bosonic creation and annihilation operator associated to every mode <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> we can build two
Hermitian operators</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{X}_j = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a}_j + \hat{a}_j^\dagger),\quad \hat{P}_j =

<p>which than satisfy the well known commutation relations <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left[\hat{X}_j, \hat{P}_k\right] =
\mathrm{i} \delta_{j,k}\)</span>. In second quantisation, the Fock space of bosons built from a
single particle system with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> modes can equivalently be thought of as a regular tensor
product space of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> distinguishable quantum particles moving on the real line, or
technically, as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(L^2(\mathbb{R})\right)^{\otimes L}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For fermions, we can also construct Hermitian operators out of the creation and annihilation
operators, which we denote as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{\eta}^{(1)}_j = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a}_j + \hat{a}_j^\dagger),\quad
\hat{\eta}^{(2)}_j = \frac{-\mathrm{i}}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a}_j - \hat{a}_j^\dagger).\]</div>
<p>In this case, we find that they satisfy the anticommutation relation</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\{ \hat{\eta}^{(\alpha)}_j, \hat{\eta}^{(\beta)}_k \} = \delta_{\alpha,\beta} \delta_{j,k}\]</div>
<p>so that the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\eta}^{(1)}\)</span> type operators and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\eta}^{(2)}\)</span> type operators behave
similarly. In that case, one often uses a different notation by setting</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{\chi}_{2j-1} = \hat{\eta}^{(1)}_j = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a}_j +

These Hermitian fermionic operators are referred to as <strong>Majorana operators</strong>.</p>
<p>Note furthermore that the Fock space of fermions built from a single particle system with
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> modes looks remarkably like a system of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> qubits, i.e. the tensor product
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes L}\)</span>. While this is true for how the occupation number basis vectors
are labelled, one important fact is that the operators <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{a}_j\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{a}_j^\dagger\)</span>
should not be thought of as local operators that act nontrivially on the single site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>,
and as the identity elsewhere, since they do not mutually commute, but rather anticommute.
It is possible to map these fermionic creation and annihilation operators to ‘nonlocal’
qubit operators using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93Wigner_transformation">Jordan-Wigner transformation</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>With these creation and annihilation operators, we can now represent general operators in a
way that does not depend on the precise number of particles in the system. The simplest case
are ‘single-particle’ operators, i.e. operators that were defined with respect to the
single-particle Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(1)}\)</span>. The easiest case are operators which are
are diagonal with respect to the chosen single-particle basis. In that case, every particle
one of the eigenmodes of the single-particle operator will give a contribution that equals
the associated eigenvalue. Hence, the many-body representation of such an operator is given
by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{O}^{(1)} = \sum_{j} \lambda_j \ket{j}\bra{j} \quad \rightarrow \quad \hat{O} = \sum_{j}
\lambda_j \hat{a}_j^\dagger \hat{a}_j.\]</div>
<p>However, we can easily transform away from the basis of eigenmodes to a general set of
modes, and then find</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{O}^{(1)} = \sum_{j,k} O_{j,k} \ket{j}\bra{k} \quad \rightarrow \quad \hat{O} =
\sum_{j,k} O_{j,k} \hat{a}_j^\dagger \hat{a}_k.\]</div>
<p>Vice versa, if you are given an operator that only contains terms where every term contains
exactly one creation and one annilation operator, then it is especially easy to diagonalise
this operator, since one only needs to diagonalise the corresponding single-particle version
of the operator. When the Hamiltonian of the many-body system is of this form, the system is
said to be <em>free</em> or noninteracting.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There is a larger class of operators that can easily be diagonalised, namely operators where
every term is quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators. This means that every
term contains either a creation and an annilation operator, or two creation operators, or
two annihilation operators. Such Hamiltonians are said to be quadratic or Gaussian, and can
be diagonalised using a
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogoliubov_transformation">Bogoliubov transformation</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, there exist two-particle operators, in particular, typical interaction terms in
the Hamiltonian such as the Coulomb interaction between electrons. Such operators take the
form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{O}^{(2)} = \sum_{j,k,l,m} O_{j,k; l,m} \ket{j,k} \bra{l,m}\]</div>
<p>and can be translated to act on the full Fock space as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{O} = \sum_{j\leq k; l\leq m} O_{(j,k); (l,m)} \hat{a}_{j}^\dagger \hat{a}_k^\dagger
\hat{a}_m \hat{a}_l = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{j, k; l, m} O_{(j,k); (l,m)} \hat{a}_{j}^\dagger
\hat{a}_k^\dagger \hat{a}_m \hat{a}_l.\]</div>
<p>As soon as such type of operators are present in the Hamiltonian (which thus contain more
than two creation of annihilation operators), it becomes impossible to diagonalise the
Hamiltonian based on a simple calculation in the single-particle Hilbert space, and the
exponentially large many-body Hilbert space need to be considered.</p>

<p>Having introduced the Hilbert space and Hamiltonian of quantum many-body systems, we still
need to define which states we are actually interested in, and which type of observables we
want to compute for such states. So far, we have only mentioned that isolated systems have a
quantum state which corresponds to a vector (or rather a ray of vectors) in its Hilbert
space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>. Before answering this question, we first need to generalize our concept
of a quantum state.</p>
<div class="section" id="quantum-states-revisited">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.4.1. </span>Quantum States Revisited<a class="headerlink" href="#quantum-states-revisited" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>More abstractly and generally, the quantum state of a system can be introduced as a map from
observables (operators) to numbers (expectation values). This is typically denoted as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho:
\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H}) \mapsto \mathbb{C}:\hat{A} \to \hat{A}\)</span>. Here,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H})\)</span> is the set of linear operators (a.k.a endomorphisms) on
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>. This set is itself a vector space, as we can consider linear combinations of
linear operators. Furthermore, as we can compose two linear operators and obtain a new
linear operator, we have a product operation, which makes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H})\)</span> into an
algebra. Finally, we have defined the concept of the adjoint of an operator, which in
mathematics terminology gives <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H})\)</span> the structure of a
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C^\ast\)</span>-algebra.</p>
<p>The map <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span> that represents a quantum state should have a number of properties, that
generalise those of the case we have encountered so far, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho(\hat{A}) =
\frac{\braket{\Psi\vert \hat{A} \vert \Psi}}{\braket{\Psi | \Psi}}\)</span>. In particular, this map
is linear with respect to linear combinations of operators. This implies that it can be
written as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho(\hat{A}) = \mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{\rho}\hat{A}\right]\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span>
is now itself an element of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H})\)</span> (technically, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span> is an element
from the dual space of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{H})\)</span>). Furthermore, we must have that our state
gives rise to nonnegative and normalised probabilities, which implies that</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho(\hat{1}) = \mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{\rho}\right] = 1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho(\hat{P}) \geq 0\)</span> for any projector, and more generally, for any positive definite
operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}\)</span>. This implies that the associated operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span>, known as the
<strong>density operator</strong> or density matrix (when expressed with respect to a chosen basis),
is itself a positive (and thus self-adjoint) operator, which is furthermore normalised
to have trace one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The particular case where the state of the system was given by a vector
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\in\mathbb{H}\)</span> corresponds to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}=\frac{\ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi}}{\braket{\Psi\vert \Psi}}\)</span> and thus satisfies
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^2=\hat{\rho}\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span> is itself a projector. Such states are called
<em>pure states</em>. All density operators which do not have this property are called <em>mixed
states</em>.</p>
<p>Being positive definite operators, any density operator admits a spectral decomposition of
the form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{\rho} = \sum_{n} p_n \ket{\Phi_n}\bra{\Phi_n}\]</div>
<p>where the states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\Phi_n}\}\)</span> form an orthonormal set and the eigenvalues <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n\)</span>
satisfy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sum_{n} p_n =1 \)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n \geq 0\)</span> (which together also yields <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n &lt; 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>Mixed states arise in the quantum world in two scenarios:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>If the system is not isolated, but is rather a subsystem of a larger system and
interacting with its complement therein. This is discussed in the next section.</p></li>
<li><p>Even for an isolated system, it can happen that the state is not exactly known and one
must deal with classical uncertaintity and probability. Indeed, a mixed state can be
interpreted as a statistical ensemble. If the system can be prepared into different (not
necessarily orthogonal) states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\Psi_1}, \ket{\Psi_2}, \ldots\}\)</span> with
probabilities <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_1, p_2, \ldots\)</span> that sum up to one, then the state of the system is
given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{\rho} = p_1 \ket{\Psi_1}\bra{\Psi_1} + p_2 \ket{\Psi_2}\bra{\Psi_2} +
\ldots\]</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this does not necessarily correspond to the spectral decomposition of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span>, as the states <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi_i}\)</span> are not necessarily orthogonal. It is nonetheless
a valid density operator. More generally, given two density operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}_1\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}_2\)</span>, aany convex combination <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho} = p \hat{\rho}_1 + (1-p) \hat{\rho}_2\)</span>
with thus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0 \leq p \leq 1\)</span> is a valid density operator.</p>
<p>To a mixed state, we can associate the Von Neumann entropy</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[S(\hat{\rho}) = - \mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{\rho}\log \hat{\rho}\right] = - \sum_{n} p_n \log(p_n)\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n\)</span> the eigenvalues of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span>. For a pure state, the Von Neumann entropy
evaluates to zero (using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lim_{x\to 0} x \log x = 0\)</span>). The maximal value of the Von Neumann
entropy is obtained when all values <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n\)</span> are equal so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho} \sim \hat{1}\)</span>.
Because of normalisation, we then have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_n = 1/d\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> the Hilbert space dimension and
thus obtain</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[0 \leq S(\hat{\rho}) \leq \log d.\]</div>
<p>In a many-body system, the Hilbert space dimension scales exponentially with the number of
sites or number of degrees of freedom in the system. If we call this quantity the “volume”
of the system, than we can conclude that the maximal value of the Von Neumann entropy is
thus proportional to the volume of the system.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, the interpretation and meaning of the Von Neumann entropy can
differ, as we discuss below.</p>
</div>

<p>Consider a bipartite system composed of two subsystems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, with thus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H} =
\mathbb{H}^{(A)} \otimes \mathbb{H}^{(B)}\)</span>. Now suppose that we are only interested in
measuring observables that act non-trivially on subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. This might be the case if
subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is the actual quantum system that we want to model, but it is not isolated and
instead interacting with an environment, corresponding to subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. With the axioms so
far, we are forced to include the environment into our discussion. Only the combined system</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>environment can be assigned a pure state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span>. However, this seems complete
overkill, as the environment might extend the whole universe and so it will be impossible to
know the complete state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span>. Since we are only interested in observables that act
nontrivially on the system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, i.e. all observables that we want to measure take the form
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{O}^A = \hat{O} \otimes \hat{1}_B\)</span>, and thus we expect that a reduced and simplified
description must exist.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let us now assume that the Hilbert space of subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is spanned by a basis
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\psi_k}, k=1,\dots, d^A\}\)</span> and the Hilbert space of subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> is spanned by a
basis <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\varphi_l}, l=1,\ldots, d^B\}\)</span>. A reduced description for the system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> can
be obtained by observing that we can write</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\braket{\Psi \vert \hat{O}^A \vert \Psi} &amp;= \mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{O} \otimes \hat{1}_B \ket{\Psi} \bra{\Psi}\right]\\
&amp;= \sum_{k = 1}^{d^A}\sum_{l = 1}^{d^B} \left(\bra{\psi_k} \otimes \bra{\varphi_l}\right) \left(\hat{O} \otimes \hat{1}_B\right) \ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi}\left(\ket{\psi_k} \otimes \ket{\varphi_l}\right)\\
&amp;= \sum_{k = 1}^{d^A}] \bra{\psi_k} \hat{O} \left[ \sum_{l=1}^{d^B} \bra{\varphi_l} \ket{\Psi} \bra{\Psi} \ket{\varphi_l}\right] \ket{\psi_k}\\
&amp;= \mathrm{Tr}_A \left[\hat{O} \mathrm{Tr}_B\left(\ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi} \right)\right]\\
&amp;= \mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{O} \hat{\rho}^{(A)}\right]\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Hence, subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> an be described in terms of a mixed state that is obtained as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{\rho}^A = \mathrm{Tr}_B \ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi} = \sum_{l=1}^{d^B} \bra{\varphi_l}
\ket{\Psi} \bra{\Psi} \ket{\varphi_l}\]</div>
<p>This construction is known as a <em>partial trace</em> and the resulting mixed state of subsystem
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> as the <em>reduced density operator</em>. It is based on the fact that by using a tensor
product basis for the joint Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{H}^{(A)} \otimes
\mathbb{H}^{(B)}\)</span>, a trace operation leads to a double sum, namely one over all basis
vectors for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^A\)</span> and one over all basis vectors for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^B\)</span>. Hence, the
complete trace can be interpreted as the composition of two partial traces, one over
subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and one over subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. If all relevant operators act trivially on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>,
the partial trace over <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> can be performed directly on the state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^{(AB)} =
\ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi}\)</span> and gives rise to the reduced density matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^{(A)}\)</span>. Some
notes are in order.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While we made reference to a specific tensor product basis to define this construction,
the concepts of reduced density operator and partial trace do not depend on the specific
choice of basis for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(A)}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}^{(B)}\)</span>. The construction only
requires a tensor product basis to expose the tensor product structure of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>While we have assumed that the total system is described by a pure state
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^{(AB)} = \ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi}\)</span>. However, for the construction of the reduced
density opeator as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^{(A)} = \mathrm{Tr}_B \hat{\rho}^{(AB)}\)</span> this is not
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>With can expand the whole construction with respect to an explicitly chosen basis. If
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi} = \sum_{k=1}^{d^A} \sum_{l=1}^{d^B} \Psi_{k,l} \ket{k}\otimes \ket{l}\)</span>, we
find</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{\rho}^{(AB)} = \sum_{k,k'=1}^{d^A} \sum_{l,l'=1}^{d^B} \Psi_{k,l} \Psi_{k',l'}^\ast
\left(\ket{k}\otimes \ket{l}\right) \left(\bra{k'}\otimes \bra{l'}\right)\]</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{\rho}^{(A)} = \sum_{k,k'=1}^{d^A} \sum_{l=1}^{d^B} \Psi_{k,l} \Psi_{k',l}^\ast
\ket{k}\bra{k'}\]</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the reduced density operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}^A\)</span> is pure, this indicates that the state
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span> was itself a tensor product. In all other cases, the subsystems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> are
said to be entangled. This entanglement can be quantified by computing the Von Neumann
entropy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\hat{\rho}^A)\)</span>, which is then called the <strong>entanglement entropy</strong> of the combined
system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. Indeed, that this entropy is a property of how both subsystems are
entangled follows from the fact that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\hat{\rho}^A) = S(\hat{\rho}^B)\)</span>, i.e.\ it doesn’t
matter whether the Von Neumann entropy of the reduced density operator of subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> or
of subsystem <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> is computed. This is only true if the total system is in a pure state
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span>. When also the total system is in a mixed state, because of classical
randomness, then it is harder to differentiate between true quantum entanglement and
classical probability.</p>
<p>To conclude, we analyze the case where the combined system is in a pure state a bit more.
If we again expand <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span> with respect to the tensor product basis as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\Psi} = \sum_{k=1}^{d^A} \sum_{l=1}^{d^B} \Psi_{k,l} \ket{k}\otimes \ket{l}\]</div>
<p>and interpret its expansion coefficients <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Psi_{k,l}\)</span> as the entries of a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^A \times d^B\)</span>
matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span>. The reduced density operators can now be written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{\rho}^A = \sum_{k,k'=1}^{d^A} [C C^\dagger]_{k,k'} \ket{k}\bra{k'}\quad
\text{and}\quad\hat{\rho}^A = \sum_{k,k'=1}^{d^A} [C^\dagger C]_{l,l'} \ket{l}\bra{l'}\]</div>
<p>Hence, the reduced density matrices for subsystems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> are related by the fact that
they correspond to the two different ways in which we can multiply the matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> with its
Hermitian conjugate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C^\dagger\)</span>. It is a well-known result from linear algebra that for two
matrices <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A \in \mathbb{C}^{d_1 \times d_2}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B \in \mathbb{C}^{d_2 \times d_1}\)</span>, the
square matrices <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A B \in \mathbb{C}^{d_1 \times d_1}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(BA \in \mathbb{C}^{d_2 \times
d_2}\)</span> have the same set of nonzero eigenvalues, counted with degeneracy. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_1 \neq d_2\)</span>,
the larger of the two matrices will have additional eigenvalues zero. This result already
proofs the equality <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\hat{\rho}^{(A)}) = S(\hat{\rho}^{(B)})\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, we can even make this more explicit. We can decompose the matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C \in
\mathbb{C}^{d^A \times d^B}\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C = U S V^\dagger\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span> unitary matrices (of
size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^A \times d^A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^B \times d^B\)</span> respectively), and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^A \times d^B\)</span> matrix
which only has nonzero entries on the diagonal. Furthermore, the nonzero entries of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> can
be chosen positive in descending order. This decomposition is known as the <strong>singular value
decomposition</strong>. For further reference, we denote the diagonal elements of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i =
S_{i,i}\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i=1,\ldots, \mathrm{min}(d^A,d^B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The unitary matrices <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span> can be interpreted as basis transforms in the subsystems
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> respectively, i.e. they define a new basis (which is thus specific to the chosen
state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span>), which we denote as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\psi^{(A)}_k}, k= 1,\ldots, d^A\}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{\psi^{(B)}_l}, l= 1,\ldots, d^B\}\)</span>. We can then write</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\ket{\Psi} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{\min(d^A,d^B)} s_i \ket{\psi^A_i} \otimes \ket{\psi^B_i}\\
\hat{\rho}^{(A)} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{d^A} (s_i)^2 \ket{\psi^A_i} \bra{\psi^A_i}\\
\hat{\rho}^{(B)} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{d^b} (s_i)^2 \ket{\psi^B_i} \bra{\psi^B_i}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Hence, the reduced matrices appear immidiately in diagonalised form. The singular values
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span>, or rather their squares <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_i = (s_i)^2\)</span> are referred to as Schmidt coefficients, and
together make up the <strong>entanglement spectrum</strong>. The entanglement entropy is then given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-entanglement-entropy">
<span class="eqno">(1.1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-entanglement-entropy" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[S = - \sum_{i} p_i \log(p_i)\]</div>
<p>In all of this, it is clear that subsystems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> were treated on equal footing, and
it does in fact not matter which of the two is chosen to probe the entanglement structure of
the state.</p>
<p>If the entanglement entropy evaluates to zero, the two subsystems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> are said to be
unentangled, and the state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span> actually factorises as a tensor product
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\psi^A} \otimes \ket{\psi^B}\)</span>. As soon as the entanglement entropy is nonzero, the two
subsystems are entangled. As stated above, the entropy is upper bounded, in this case by the
logarithm of the smallest of the two Hilbert space dimensions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^A\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^B\)</span>. Thus, if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^A
\leq d^B\)</span>, we find that the entanglement entropy satisfies</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[0 \leq S \leq \log(d^A).\]</div>
<p>It turns out that states that are randomly selected from the Hilbert space typically have
an entanglement entropy that is close to maximal.</p>

physically interesting states. Firstly, when considering a system that is in contact with a

<p>The Von Neumann entropy of the Gibbs state corresponds to the thermodynamical notion of
entropy. In a many-body system, the thermal entropy at finite temperature will be extensive
and thus scale with the volume of the system, just like the energy expectation value, so
that together the free energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E - T S\)</span> is minimised.</p>
<p>At infinite temperature (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta=0\)</span>), we obtain <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho} \sim \hat{1}\)</span> and the Von Neumann
entropy reaches its upper bound. At zero temperature (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta \to +\infty\)</span>), we obtain
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho} \sim \hat{P}_0\)</span>, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{P}_0\)</span> the projector onto the eigenspace of lowest
energy. Hence, in that case the Von Neumann entropy is given by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log(d_0)\)</span>, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_0\)</span> the
lowest energy eigenvalue, i.e. the dimension of the ground state subspace. Most quantum
lattice systems have a single or at least a small number of linearly indepenent ground
states, so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_0\)</span> is a small number independent of the system size. However, there are
also cases where the number of ground states scales exponentially with the system size, and
the thermal entropy remains extensive at zero temperature. This then constitutes a violation
of the infamous third law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>While the heat bath or environment with which the system interacts is in practice typically
much “larger” (in terms of number of degrees of freedom and thus Hilbert space dimension),
we can use a property that any mixed state can be obtained as the reduced density operator
from a pure state in a Hilbert space that is the tensor product of two copies of the
system’s Hilbert space, or thus, where the environment is just exactly as large as the
system. Writing a mixed state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\rho}\)</span> as the reduced density operator of a pure state
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span> in a Hilbert space <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{H}^S \otimes \mathbb{H}^E\)</span> is known as
a <em>purification</em>. With respect to the purification, all expectation values can be obtained
as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{O} \hat{\rho}\right] = \braket{\Psi \vert \hat{O} \otimes \hat{1}_E \vert \Psi}\]</div>
<p>which can be an advantage if one has an efficient (mathematical, computational, …) formalism
for working with pure states. We can thus always construct such a purification by just
taking the environment to be a copy of the system. Note that the environment in this
construction is merely an auxiliary tool, and has no physical meaning or relation to the
actual environment. If the Hilbert space of the system is described by a basis <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\ket{j},
j=1,\dots, d\}\)</span>, then we can first build a purification if the infinite temperature state as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\Psi_0} = \sum_{j} \ket{j}_S \otimes \ket{j}_E\]</div>
<p>In particular, if the system is a many-body system and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j}\)</span> is itself already a tensor
product basis state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{j_1} \otimes \ket{j_2} \otimes \ldots\)</span>, we can organise the
environment so that matching tensor product factors between system and environment are taken
together. This has the advantage that the infinite temperature state can be written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\Psi_0} = \left(\sum_{j_1} \ket{j_1}_S \otimes \ket{j_1}_E\right) \otimes \left(\sum_{j_2} \ket{j_2}_S \otimes \ket{j_2}_E\right) \otimes \ldots\]</div>
<p>and still has an overall tensor product structure. A purification of the finite temperature
state can then be obtained as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\ket{\Psi_\beta} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{Z(\beta)}} \sum_{j=1}^{d} \left(\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\beta}{2} \hat{H}} \ket{j}_S \right)\otimes \ket{j}_E \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{Z(\beta)}} \exp\left(-\frac{\beta}{2} \hat{H} \otimes \hat{1}_E \right) \ket{\Psi_0}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>This expression now looks remarkibly similar to how to compute a time-evolved state, by
replacing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-\mathrm{i} t \mapsto -\beta/2\)</span>. Hence, methods that solve Schrödinger’s equation
and are sufficiently general to also work with imaginary values of the time coordinate can
be used to prepare thermal states.</p>

<p>As quantum effects are most pronounced at zero temperature, we typically assume to be
operating in this regime. It then follows that we are mostly interested in the lowest energy
states of the Hamiltonian, and in particular in the ground state(s).</p>
<p>A trivial but nonetheless important property of ground states is that they can easily be
characterised as states that minimise the expectation value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{\Psi \vert \hat{H} |
\Psi}\)</span>. Indeed, this forms the basis for the variational principle. If we have a set of
trial states, in which there are a number of free parameters, than we can construct an
approximation to the ground state by ‘simply’ minimising the energy expectation value of the
Hamiltonian with respect to these free parameters. How good this approximation is in
practice depends on the properties of both the Hamiltonian and the trial states. However,
one way to quantify the quality of the ground state approximation is by computing the energy
variance</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{\Psi \vert (\hat{H} - \braket{\Psi \vert \hat{H} \vert \Psi})^2 \vert \Psi} =
\braket{\Psi \vert \hat{H}^2 \vert \Psi} - \braket{\Psi \vert \hat{H} \vert \Psi}^2.\]</div>
<p>The Hamiltonians for quantum lattice systems that we are interested in, will typically
contain a sum of terms where every individual term acts nontrivially only in a small patch
of the lattice. For such Hamiltonians, the low-energy states have a special property.
Hereto, we consider arbitrary bipartitions of the system, where one subsystem corresponds to
a (connected) region of sites, whereas the complement, i.e.\ the remaining sites in the
lattice, make up the second subsystem. The ground state will in general not factorize into a
tensor product, as it contains correlations and entanglement between these two (arbitrarily
chosen) subsystems. As pointed out above, the maximal value of entanglement entropy is given
by the logarithm of the smallest of the two Hilbert space dimensions. Assuming that our
chosen region of sites is smaller than its complement, its Hilbert space will itself scale
exponentially with the number of sites in that region, i.e.\ with its volume. Hence, the
entanglement entropy computed for such a bipartition has an upper bound that is proportional
to the volume of the subsystem. As was also stated above, random states typically satisfy
this upper bound. However, the special property of low-energy states of locally interacting
Hamiltonians is exactly that they have much less entanglement. They typically have an
entanglement entropy that only scales with the common area between the subsystem and its
complement. This scaling behavior is referred to as the <strong>area law of entanglement entropy</strong>
and provides the key motivation for approximating such low energy states using a tensor
network decomposition. It indicates that the most important quantum correlations are short
range (just like the interactions that generate them), and are thus situated across the
boundary connecting the subsystem and its complement. However, this does not exclude that
there is also a small amount of nontrivial long-range correlations in the system.</p>
<p>Aside from the ground state, one might also be interested in the first excited states, as
these will be important for understanding how the system at zero temperature reacts to
external perturbations. In a macroscopically large many-body system, one should not expect
that the energy spectrum consists of a number of discrete levels with gaps in between. The
lowest-energy excited states in a quantum lattice system can typically be given a
particle-like interpretation, as is well known from quantum field theory. They correspond to
small bumps of energy, i.e. they can be thought of as perturbations of the ground state in a
small region and thus have an anergy cost that does not scale with the system size. However,
because of kinetic energy-like terms, actual eigenstates will not correspond to having this
energy bump in a localized region, but will rather be in a superposition where the
“particle” is delocalized. In particular, in the case of a translation invariant system, the
eigenstates will also be momentum eigenstates, and thus describe a particle that is in a
momentum superposition across the lattice. The energy (surplus) of such a particle like
excitation will thus be a number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon(k)\)</span> that is of order <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> independent of the
system size, and that depends on the specific momentum. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon(k)\)</span> is everywhere lower
bounded by some value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\)</span> (again indepenent of system size), then the system is said to
be gapped. However, in some systems, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon(k)\)</span> can become zero for particular values of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>. Such systems are called gapless, and they often correspond to phase transition points,
where the nature of the ground state radically changes if the parameters in the Hamiltonian
are varied.</p>
<p>The energy spectrum of a quantum lattice system will then consist of one or a few ground
states, the energy of which is an extensive number that is most easily expressed as some
energy density per site. To study the excited states, it is then convenient to shift the
energy scale such that the ground state energy is zero. The lowest excited states will then
correspond to particles which can be created at a certain momentum. In an energy-momentum
diagram, their dispersion relation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon(k)\)</span> will apear as an isolated band. Note that a
system can have different types of such particle-like excitations, each with their own
dispersion relation. Higher up in the energy spectrum we start to obtain regions
corresponding to states with two- or more particles, that are travelling independent from
each other. For such states, the energy can be obtained simply as the sum of the indivual
particles in the state, and since the relative momentum of the particles can change while
keeping the total momentum fixed, the energy in such states can also vary continuously (at
least in the thermodynamic limit).</p>

<p>Aside from low-energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, we are often also interested in states
that have a non-trivial time depence. One particular use case is where one starts from the
ground state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi_0}\)</span> of a certain Hamiltonian <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}_0\)</span>, and then some parameters
in the Hamiltonian are suddenly changed, so that the Hamiltonian now corresponds to a new
operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}_1\)</span>. This sudden change is reminiscent of quenching a system, and such a
setup is called a global quench. We then want to compute</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ket{\Psi(t)} = \exp(-\mathrm{i} t \hat{H}_1) \ket{\Psi_0}.\]</div>
<p>With respect to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}_1\)</span>, the state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi_0}\)</span> will no longer be a ground state and
most likely not even be an eigenstate. However, it will have a certain (extensive)
energy expectation value that is preserved throughout the evolution.</p>
<p>In terms of entanglement and correlations, even when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi_0}\)</span> is a state with an area
law entanglement scaling (because it is a low-energy state of another local Hamiltonian,
namely <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}_0\)</span>), the entanglement in the state will grow rapidly with time. Indeed, the
bipartite entanglement entropy for will tend to grow linearly with time. From the
perspective of a given subsystem, its entropy will grow from an initial value proportional
to the area of the subsystem, until it saturates at a value that is propertional to the
volume of the subsystem. This process is known as thermalisation, as it turns out that at
that point, the subsystem is locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state with a temperature
set by the energy density of the initial state. The subsystem has thermalized with respect
to its complement behaving as an environment or heat bath. The larger the subsystem, the
longer it will take before thermalisation is complete, and the overall state of the global
system remains a pure state, albeit a highly entangled one.</p>

<div class="section" id="observables-and-static-and-dynamic-correlation-functions">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.4.6. </span>Observables and Static and Dynamic Correlation Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#observables-and-static-and-dynamic-correlation-functions" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There are a number of typical observables that we want to measure for a given quantum state
(ground state or thermal state) of a quantum lattice system. The first are operators which
have the same structure as the Hamiltonian, in being given by a sum of terms where every
individual term acts nontrivially only on a single site, or a small patch of neighbouring
sites. Furthermore, these terms all act identically, except that they are translated to the
different patches that make up the lattice. Typical examples include the energy itself or
specific contributions to it (kinetic energy, interaction energy, … ) as well as the total
number of particles, a total magnetisation, and other similar quantities.</p>
<p>Let us use the transverse field Ising model as an example. An interesting quantity in the
transverse field Ising model is the longitudinal magnetisation, given by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^z=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n} \sigma^z_n\)</span>. The expectation value of such operators is
extensive, and so we are typically interested in the associated density, which is obtained
by dividing out the volume factor. With respect to a translation-invariant state, this is
equivalent to simply measuring the expectation value of a single term, i.e.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{2} \sigma^z\)</span> in the case of the longitudinal magnetisation, which is thus a local
operator. The precise position where it acts does then not really matter.</p>
<p>Such quantities come up for example to measure potential symmetry breaking, where an operator that should
have zero expectation value given the symmetries of the Hamiltonian, actually acquires a
nonzero expectation value. Indeed, given that the Ising Hamiltonian has
the property that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left[\hat{H},\hat{U}\right] = 0\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{U} = \bigotimes_{n} \sigma^x_n\)</span>,
we also expect the ground state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi_0}\)</span> to satisfy
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{U} \ket{\Psi_0} \sim \ket{\Psi_0}\)</span>, where the proportionality factor can only be plus
or minus one, due to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{U}^2 = \hat{1}\)</span>. The magnetisation in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>-direction, on the
other hand, satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{U}^\dagger \hat{S}^z \hat{U} = - \hat{S}^z\)</span>, so that we expect</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{\Psi_0 \vert \hat{S}^z \vert \Psi_0} = 0\]</div>
<p>Indeed, if the ground state is unique, this is precisely what happens. However, it can
happen that there are multiple linearly independent ground states. In that case, the
restriction of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{S}^z\)</span> into the ground subspace can be nontrivial, and there exist
specific ground state choices for which the expectation value is nonzero. For reasons that
go beyond what can be explained here, it are typically these states which are easiest to
create or approximate (they have lower entanglement). Such operators that can characterise
the presence of symmetry breaking are referred to as <em>order parameters</em>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the use of local operators to probe the ground state properties is somewhat
limited. A different class of observables that are of typical interest are (static)
correlation functions, which take the form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ C^{A,B}_{i,j} = \braket{\Psi\vert \hat{A}_i^\dagger \hat{B}_j\vert \Psi} \]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}_i\)</span> is a local operator acting on or in the neighbourhood of site (or unit
cell) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{B}_j\)</span> is a local operator acting on or in the neighbourhood of site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>.
Typically, the operators <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{B}\)</span> are chosen such that their local expectation
value is zero. If this is not the case, we can subtract these local expectation values by
redefining</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ C^{A,B}_{i,j} = \braket{\Psi\vert (\hat{A}_i - \braket{\Psi\vert\hat{A}_i\vert \Psi})^\dagger (\hat{B}_j - \braket{\Psi\vert\hat{B}_j\vert \Psi})\vert \Psi} = \braket{\Psi\vert \hat{A}_i \hat{B}_j\vert \Psi} -  \braket{\Psi\vert\hat{A}_i\vert \Psi} \braket{\Psi\vert\hat{B}_j\vert \Psi}.\]</div>
<p>We are then interested in the dependence of this correlation function on the positions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>. In particular, in a translation invariant system, it is only the relative lattice
vector from site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> to site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> on which this quantity depends. It can be proven that if
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span> is the unique ground state of a gapped local Hamiltonian, then the asymptotic
behaviour of such correlation functions is that they decay exponentially in the distance
between the two sites. This exponential thus defines a length scale <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\xi\)</span> via <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\exp(-d/\xi)\)</span>
with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> the relevant distance. The length scale <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\xi\)</span> is known as the correlation length of
the system.</p>
<p>When the system is gapless, static correlation functions still go to zero in the limit of
infinite separation distance, but rather decay as an algebraic function of the distance,
i.e. they give rise to power laws. The exponents that appear in these power laws do
typically have universal values that are set by general properties such as the number of
spatial dimensions, the global symmetries in the system, etc. In particular for the case of
one-dimensional system, there is a rich literature and well developed framework for
analysing such gapless systems using methods from conformal field theory.</p>
<p>Finally, in systems with potential symmetry breaking, the static correlation function of the
order parameter with itself is an extremely useful diagnostic. In particular, when the system
has symmetry breaking, the large distance limit of the correlation function does not vanish
and the system is said to contain <em>long range order</em>. Unlike the expectation value of the local
order parameter, which can have a nonzero expectation value for particularly chosen
symmetry breaking ground states but is still zero for other choices of ground states, the
value of the correlation function and its large distance limit is insensitive to the specifically
chosen ground state out of the ground subspace that it is computed with. For the transverse-field
Ising model, symmetry breaking will thus be present whenever</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ C_{i,j} = \braket{\Psi \vert \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_j \vert \Psi} \]</div>
<p>does not decay to zero limit for large distance between sites <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>. The limiting
value of this correlation function can then be considered as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m^2\)</span>, i.e. the square of the
local magnetisation that would be measured in some states of the ground subspace.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the ground state static correlation function does not provide information
about excited states or other dynamical information of the Hamiltonian. In most physical
system, it however does provide some qualitative information. Since the static correlation
function, considered as a matrix with rows <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and columns <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>, has a particular structure
resulting from translation invariance, it can be diagonalised by a (multidimensional)
discrete Fourier transform. The resulting eigenvalues depend on the lattice momentum
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa\)</span> and are known as the static structure factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\kappa)\)</span>. In particular, in the
case of a gapped system with unique ground state, these values are well defined for all
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa\)</span>. Nonetheless, it can be argued (using different techniques) that maxima for
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\kappa)\)</span> will correspond to momenta where the single particle excitations have minima in
their dispersion relations. For critical systems, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\kappa)\)</span> can also have algebraic
divergences, whereas in the case of long range order, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\kappa)\)</span> will contain a Dirac-delta
type of divergence, typically at zero momentum, unless there is some spatially repeating
pattern in the way symmetry is broken (and thus also translation invariance is broken).</p>
<p>More detailed quantitative information about the spectrum of excited states is contained in
the time-dependent correlation function</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split} G^{A,B}_{i,j}(t) &amp;= \braket{\Psi_0\vert  \hat{A}_i(t)^\dagger \hat{B}_j(0)\vert \Psi_0}\\

<p>On the first line, we have used operator
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}(t) = \mathrm{e}^{+\mathrm{i} t \hat{H}}\hat{A} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} t \hat{H}}\)</span>
in the Heisenberg picture. In going from the second to the third line, we have used that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi_0}\)</span> is the ground state of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}\)</span> with ground state energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_0\)</span>. Again, this
quantity will depend on the relative lattice vector connecting sites <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> in a
translation-invariant system. Once again, we can diagonalise the spatial dependence using a
multidimensional discrete Fourier transform. If we now furthermore also perform a Fourier
transform of the time-dependence into frequency space, we obtain the <em>dynamical structure
factor</em> given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ S^{A,B}(\kappa, \omega) = \sum_{n} \delta(\omega- (E_n - E_0))\braket{\Psi_0 \vert \hat{A}(\kappa)^\dagger | \Psi_n}\braket{\Psi_n \ \hat{B}(k\kappa) \vert \Psi_0} \]</div>
<p>Here, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}(k\kappa)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{B}(\kappa)\)</span> correspond to the discrete Fourier transforms
of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{A}_i\)</span>, which amounts to the momentum superposition. As a consequence,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{B}(\kappa) \ket{\Psi_0}\)</span> is a state with definite momentum <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> (provided the ground
state is translation invariant), and thus only has overlap with excited states
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\Psi_n}\)</span> with momentum <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa\)</span>. Because of the factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta(\omega - (E_n -E_0))\)</span>,

\[\braket{\hat{O}} = \lim_{\tau\to\infty} \braket{\phi\vert \mathrm{e}^{-\tau \hat{H}} \hat{O} \mathrm{e}^{-\tau \hat{H}}\vert \phi}/\braket{\phi\vert\mathrm{e}^{-2\tau \hat{H}} \vert\phi}\]</div>
<p>This expression can be compared to the thermal expectation value with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta = 2\tau\)</span>; the
only difference is in the boundary conditions.</p>
<p>For a quantum many body system, taking the exponential is as hard as determining the full
diagonalisation of the hamiltonian, which is impossible due to the exponentially large
Hilbert space. If the hamiltonian is a sum of local terms, each of these terms can be
exponentiated easily, but for arbitrary <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> there is no relation ship between
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\exp(-\tau \sum_{i} \hat{h}_i)\)</span> and the individual <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\exp(-\tau \hat{h}_i)\)</span>, unless the
different <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{h}_i\)</span> commute. However, for an infinitesimal time step <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span>, we can
use to Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula (or better yet, the Zassenhaus formula) to obtain</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\exp(-\epsilon \sum_{i} \hat{h}_i) = \prod_i \exp(-\epsilon \hat{h}_i) +
\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2).\]</div>
<p>This then leads to the <strong>Suzuki-Trotter decomposition</strong></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\exp\left(-\tau \sum_{i} \hat{h}_i\right) = \lim_{M\to\infty} \left( \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\tau}{M} \sum_i \hat{h}_i} \right)^M =\lim_{M\to\infty} \left(\prod_i \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\tau}{M} \hat{h}_i} + \mathcal{O}(M^{-1})\right)^M\]</div>
<p>Note that splitting the time interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([0,\tau]\)</span> into small segments <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon = \tau/M\)</span> is
also the starting point for deriving a path integral representation of the quantum partition
function. The next step is to insert a resolution of the identity in between the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>
different factors, where the labels of the basis will behave as classical degrees of
freedom. For obtaining a path integral, the basis should be labeled by a number of
continuous degrees of freedom, which can then become continuous functions of time in the
limit <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\to 0\)</span>. Here, instead, we will keep <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span> small but finite, and use a
discrete basis.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.5.2. </span>From quantum to statistical mechanics<a class="headerlink" href="#from-quantum-to-statistical-mechanics" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Let’s start with a quantum system in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d=0\)</span>, i.e. a small number of spins, or in particular, a single spin,
described by a hamiltonian</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{H} = - h_x \sigma^x - h_z \sigma^z\]</div>
<p>While we could in principle exponentiate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}\)</span> directly as it is a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix,
we will treat it using the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. Throughout the remainder of this
section, we will use the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma^z\)</span> basis, which we denote as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{1} = \ket{\uparrow}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{-1} = \ket{\downarrow}\)</span>. Inserting resolutions of the identity, we write</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Z(\beta) = \mathrm{Tr} \mathrm{e}^{-\beta \hat{H}} = \sum_{\{s_k\}=\pm 1}
\braket{s_1|\mathrm{e}^{-\epsilon \hat{H}}|s_2}\cdots \braket{s_M-1| \mathrm{e}^{-\epsilon
\hat{H}}|s_{M}} \cdots \braket{s_M| \mathrm{e}^{-\epsilon \hat{H}}|s_{M+1}}\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_{M+1} = s_1\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\epsilon =\beta\)</span>, and where</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\braket{s_{i}|\mathrm{e}^{-\epsilon \hat{H}}|s_{i+1}} &amp;= \braket{s_{i} \vert \mathrm{e}^{-\epsilon H} \vert s_{i+1}} \approx \braket{s_{i} \vert \mathrm{e}^{\epsilon h_z \sigma^z}\mathrm{e}^{\epsilon h_x \sigma^x} \vert s_{i+1}}\\ 
&amp;= \mathrm{e}^{\epsilon h_z s_i} \braket{s_{i} \vert \cosh(\epsilon h_x) \mathbb{1} + \sinh(\epsilon h_x) \sigma^x \vert s_{i+1}}\\
 &amp;= \mathrm{e}^{K s_{i}s_{i+1} + h s_i + f_0}
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where the parameters in the last line are given by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K= -\frac{1}{2}\log \tanh(\epsilon h_x)\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h = \epsilon h_z\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_0 =\frac{1}{2}\log[\cosh(\epsilon h_x)\sinh(\epsilon h_x)]\)</span>.</p>
<p>We thus obtain</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Z(\beta) = \sum_{s_k} \mathrm{e}^{\sum_{i=1}^{M}K s_i s_{i+1} + h s_i},\]</div>
<p>the partition function of the one-dimensional classical Ising model with periodic boundary
conditions. Indeed, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\braket{s_{i}|\mathrm{e}^{-\epsilon H}|s_{i+1}}\)</span> does exactly
correspond to the transfer matrix, and diagonalising the transfer matrix is the most
straightforward approach to solving the one-dimensional classical Ising model.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="higher-dimensional-generalisation">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.5.3. </span>Higher dimensional generalisation<a class="headerlink" href="#higher-dimensional-generalisation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We now apply the same approach to the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal
field in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> dimensions, on a hypercubic lattice. We separate the hamiltonian in two parts
according to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\hat{H} = \left(-J\sum_{\braket{i,j}} \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_j  - h_z \sum_{i} \sigma^z_i\right) + \left(- h_x \sum_{i} \sigma^x_i\right)= \hat{H}_1 + \hat{H}_2\]</div>
<p>Note that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}_2\)</span> in itself contain commuting terms, but of course don’t
mutually commute. We follow the same strategy, and will in every (imaginary) time step
introduce a resolution of the identity using the tensor product <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma^z\)</span> basis. We now denote
the basis at time step <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ket{\{s_{i,k}\}}\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> labels a site in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>
dimensional lattice hosting the quantum degrees of freedom, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> labels points along the
imaginary time axis, which emerges as a new dimension in the problem. We find</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\exp(-\epsilon \hat{H}_1)\ket{\{s_{i,k}\}} = \exp(\epsilon J \sum_{\braket{i,j}} s_{i,k} s_{j,k}+\epsilon h \sum_i s_{i,k}) \ket{\{s_{i,k}\}}\]</div>
<p>as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{H}_1\)</span> is diagonal in this basis, and</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\braket{\{s_{i,k}\}|\exp(-\epsilon \hat{H}_2)|\{s_{i,k+1}\}} = \prod_i \braket{s_{i,k}|\mathrm{e}^{-\epsilon h_x \sigma^x_i} | s_{i,k+1}} \sim \exp(K_\perp\sum_{i} s_{i,k} s_{i,k+1})\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K_\perp = \log \tanh(\epsilon h_x)\)</span> as before. Here, we have now ignored an overall
proportionality factor, which is irrelevant when using the partition function to compute
expectation values. With this, we find</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ Z(\beta) = \sum_{\{s_i,k\}} \exp\left(\sum_{k=1}^{M}\sum_{i} K_\perp s_{i,k} s_{i,k+1}+\sum_{k=1}^M\sum_{\braket{i,j}} K_\parallel s_{i,k} s_{j,k} + \sum_{k=1}^{M}\sum_{i} h s_{i,k} \right)\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K_{\parallel} = \epsilon J\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h = \epsilon h_z\)</span>. We thus find the partition
function of the classical Ising model in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d+1\)</span> dimensions with anisotropic interaction
strengths, periodic boundary condition in the imaginary time direction and a number of sites
in the time direction given by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M = \beta/\epsilon\)</span>. Hence, the ground state regime
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\to \infty\)</span> corresponds to the thermodynamic limit in this additional time direction
of the corresponding classical system, so that there are many similarities (or actually,
equivalences) between between quantum phenomena in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> dimensions and classical phenomena in
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D=d+1\)</span> dimensions. On the other hand, when the quantum system is at finite temperature
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>, the additional dimension is finite and never in the thermodynamic limit. In that
case, this extra dimension cannot cause new non-analyticities in the partition function and
finite temperature quantum systems in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> dimensions are very similar to classical systems
in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> dimensions.</p>
<p>This quantum to classical mapping can also be inverted. Taking a codimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> slice out
of a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span>-dimensional classical partition function, one obtains a transfer matrix which can
be interpreted as the exponential of a quantum hamiltonian acting on the Hilbert space of a
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d=D-1\)</span> dimensional quantum system. Hence, methods for targetting quantum ground states in
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> dimensions can also be used to study problems in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((d+1)\)</span>-dimensional classical
statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>It is clear that the quantum to classical mapping is not specific to the quantum Ising model
and can be applied to any hamiltonian. The path integral representation of the partition
function fits within the same scheme, and only differs in the fact that the limit
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\to 0\)</span> is taken such that the additional dimension becomes continuous. This is
particularly natural if also the spatial dimensions of the quantum dimension are continuous,
i.e. if we have a quantum field theory. In this case, a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D=d+1\)</span> dimensional classical
statistical field theory is obtained. For relativistic quantum field theories, where it is
common practice to explicitly count the time dimension together with the space dimensions,
imaginary time evolution leads to an action, which is equivalently a hamiltonian of a
classical field theory in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D=d+1\)</span> spatial dimensions, with full Euclidean invariance.</p>
<p>One might thus wonder if there is anything new to be learned from studying quantum ground
states. First of all, there is one important catch which we have overlooked so far. There is
no guarantee that the above process yields a classical partition function with Boltzmann
weights which are positive, or even real. While this may seem like a technical detail, it is
of major importance. The quantum to classical mapping is the basis behind the Quantum Monte
Carlo method, one the most successful numerical methods for studying quantum many body
systems. One maps the quantum problem to a classical partition function and then uses one of
the many flavours of Monte Carlo sampling. However, with non-positive Boltzmann weights, the
interpretation of a probability distribution is lost and no efficient sampling procedure can
be designed, as samples might annihilate each other. This is known as the <strong>sign problem</strong>.</p>
<p>Secondly, for many non-relativistic quantum systems, the anisotropy between the imaginary
time direction and the spatial dimensions in the corresponding classical system cannot be
ignored, even at the critical point. In those cases, critical correlations behave
differently in the spatial and the time direction, which is characterised by a dynamical
critical exponent <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>. The case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z=1\)</span> corresponds to the case where the critical point has
(emergent) rotation/Lorentz invariance between time and space.</p>
<p>A final reason to study quantum systems directly is that certain concepts are more natural
in that setting. In particular, the last 15 years, ideas from quantum information theory,
and in particular the concept of entanglement, have made their way into the standard toolbox
to study and characterize quantum many body systems.</p>
