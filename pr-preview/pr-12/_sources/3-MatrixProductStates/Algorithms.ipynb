    "# Tensor network algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have introduced tensor networks in general and have spent sometime on the particular case of MPS in one spatial dimension, it is worth taking to consider some possible applications of this tensor-network framework. While there are a large number of theoretical results in quantum many body physics based on tensor networks, for example the characterization of (symmetry-protected) topological order in one- and two-dimensional quantum systems, here we will focus more on algorithmic and numerical aspects. In this section we will give a general introduction to the kind of problems that can be tackled using tensor-network simulations and discuss an approach to simulating of dynamics in a one-dimensional quantum system as an illustrative example.\n",

    "A first setting where tensor network methods have been intensively applied is that of simulating quantum systems. . We will introduce these algorithms in the setting of discrete spin systems. Consider a system in which physical spins with a local Hilbert space $ \\mathcal H_\\lambda = \\mathbb C^d $ of dimension $ d $ are located at every site $ \\lambda $ of some lattice $ \\Lambda $, giving rise to a total Hilbert space of the system $ \\mathcal H = \\bigotimes_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} \\mathcal H_\\lambda = \\left( \\mathbb C^d \\right)^{\\otimes N}$ where $ N = |\\Lambda| $ is the total number of sites in the lattice (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:lattice}). Such a lattice system of spins naturally translates to the setting of tensor networks where each local Hilbert space then corresponds to a physical index of the lattice, and where the network geometry is (usually) chosen to reflect that of the original lattice. \n",

On the one hand it dictates the dynamics of the system, i.e., how the state of the system changes as time passes.
