    "# A Symmetric Tensor Deep Dive: Constructing Your First Tensor Map\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to construct specific `TensorMap`s which are relevant to some common physical systems, with an increasing degree of complexity. We will assume the reader has gone through the tutorial sections on [tensor network theory](tensor_networks) and [symmetries in tensor networks](symmetric_tensors). In going through these examples we aim to provide a relatively gently introduction to the meaning of [symmetry sectors](https://jutho.github.io/TensorKit.jl/latest/man/sectors/#ss_sectors) and [vector spaces](https://jutho.github.io/TensorKit.jl/latest/man/sectors/#ss_rep) within the context of [TensorKit.jl](https://jutho.github.io/TensorKit.jl/latest/), [how to initialize a `TensorMap` over a given vector space](https://jutho.github.io/TensorKit.jl/latest/man/tensors/#ss_tensor_construction) and finally how to manually set the data of a symmetric `TensorMap`. We will keep our discussion as intuitive and simple as possible, only adding as many technical details as strictly necessary to understand each example. When considering a different physical system of interest, you should then be able to adatpt these recipes and the intuition behind them to your specific problem at hand.\n",

Instead of using plain Julia arrays, we will use a representation in terms of `TensorMap`s over complex vector spaces. These will essentially just be wrappers around base arrays at this point, but their construction requires some consideration of the notion of *spaces*, which generalize the notion of `size` for arrays. Each of the operators $X$ and $Z$ acts on a local 2-dimensional complex vector space. In the context of TensorKit.jl such a space can be represented as `ComplexSpace(2)`, or using the convenient shorthand `ℂ^2`. A single-site Pauli operator maps from a domain physical space to a codomain physical space, and can therefore be represented as instances of a `TensorMap(..., ℂ^2 ← ℂ^2)`. The corresponding data can then be filled in by hand according to the familiar Pauli matrices in the following way:"

This implies that, in an appropriate basis for the local physical vector space, our local tensors would become block-diagonal where each so-called *matrix block* is labeled by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ irrep. From the same discussion, we recall that the appropriate local basis transformation is precisely the one that brings the local representation $X$ into block-diagonal form. Clearly, this transformation is nothing more than the Hadamard transformation which maps the computational basis of $Z$ eigenstates $\\{\\ket{\\uparrow}, \\ket{\\downarrow}\\}$ to that of the $X$ eigenstates $\\{\\ket{+}, \\ket{-}\\}$ defined as $\\ket{+} = \\frac{\\ket{\\uparrow} + \\ket{\\downarrow}}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $\\ket{-} = \\frac{\\ket{\\uparrow} - \\ket{\\downarrow}}{\\sqrt{2}}$.

We see that all eight valid fusion trees with two incoming irreps and two outgoing irreps [of the type above](fusiontree) are listed with their corresponding block data. Each of these blocks is an array of shape $(1, 1, 1, 1)$ since each irrep occuring in the space $V$ has degeneracy 1. Using the `fusiontrees` method and the fact that we can index a `TensorMap` using a splitting/fusion tree pair, we can now fill in the nonzero blocks of the operator by observing that the $ZZ$ operator flips the irreps of the uncoupled charges in the domain with respect to the codomain, as shown in the diagrams above.

This in contrast to the case without symmetries, where we constructed a single-site $Z$ operator and then combined them into a two-site operator. Clearly this can no longer be done when imposing $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, since a single $Z$ is not invariant under conjugation with the symmetry operator $X$. One might wonder whether it is still possible to construct a two-site Hamiltonian term by combining local objects. This is possible if one introduces an auxiliary index on the local tensors that carries a non-trivial charge. The intuition behind this will become more clear in the next example.\n",

    "### Creation and Annihilation Operators as Symmetric Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ case, it is obvious that we cannot directly construct the creation and annihilation operators as instances of a `TensorMap(..., V ← V)` since they are not invariant under conjugation by the symmetry operator. However, it is possible to construct them as `TensorMap`s using an *auxiliary vector space*, based on the following intuition. The creation operator $a^+$ violates particle number conservation by mapping the occupation number $n$ to $n + 1$. From the point of view of representation theory, this process can be thought af the *fusion* of an `U1Irrep(n)` with an `U1Irrep(1)`, naturally giving the fusion product `U1Irrep(n + 1)`. This means we can represent $a^+$ as a `TensorMap(..., V ← V ⊗ A)`, where the auxiliary vector space `A` is contains the $+1$ irrep with degeneracy 1,  `A = U1Space(1 => 1)`. Similarly, the decrease in occupation number when acting with $a^-$ can be thought of as the *splitting* of an `U1Irrep(n)` into an `U1Irrep(n - 1)` and an `U1Irrep(1)`, leading to a representation in terms of a `TensorMap(..., A ⊗ V ← V)`. Based on these observations, we can represent the matrix elements {eq}`eq:bosonopmatel` as blocks labeled by the $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ fusion trees\n",

    "Although we have made a suggestive distinction between the 'left' and 'right' versions of the operators $a_L^\\pm$ and $a_R^\\pm$, one can actually be obtained from the other by permuting the physical and auxiliary indices of the corresponding `TensorMap`s. This permutation has no effect on the actual array blocks of the tensors due to the [bosonic braiding style](https://jutho.github.io/TensorKit.jl/latest/lib/sectors/#TensorKit.BraidingStyle) of $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ irreps, so the left and right operators can in essence by seen as the 'same' tensors. This is no longer the case when considering fermionic systems, where permuting indices can in fact change the array blocks as we will see next. As consequence, it is much less clear how to construct two-site symmetric operators in terms of local symmetric objects.\n",

This means that the fusion of two irreps always gives a single irrep as the fusion product, and that exchanging two irreps in a tensor product is trivial. In practice, this implies that for tensors with these symmetries the fusion trees are completely fixed by the uncoupled charges, which uniquely define both the inner line and the coupled charge, and that tensor indices can be permuted freely without any 'strange' side effects.\n",

Similarly, while constructing symmetric tensors that correspond to the symmetric Hamiltonian terms was still quite straightforward, it is far less clear in this case how to construct these terms as contractions of local symmetric tensors representing individual creation and annihilation operators in this case. While such a decomposition can always be in principle obtained using a (now explicitly fermionic) SVD, manually constructing such tensors as we did in the bosonic case is far from trivial. Trying this would be a good exercise in working with fermionic symmetries, but it is not something we will do here.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will now move on to systems which have more complicated *non-Abelian* symmetries. For a non-Abelian symmetry group $G$, the fact that its elements do not all commute has a profound impact on its representation theory. In particular, the irreps of such a group can be higher dimensional, and the fusion of two irreps can give rise to multiple different irreps. On the one hand this means that fusion trees of these irreps are no longer completely determined by the uncoupled charges. Indeed, in this case some of the [internal structure of the `FusionTree` type](fusion_trees) we have ignored before will become relevant (of which we will give an [example below](sun_heisenberg)). On the other hand, it follows that fusion trees of irreps now not only label blocks, but also encode a certain *nontrivial symmetry structure*. We will make this statement more precise in the following, but the fact that this is necessary is quite intuitive. If we recall our original statement that symmetric tensors consist of blocks associated to fusion trees which carry irrep labels, then for higher-dimensional irreps the corresponding fusion trees must encode some additional information that implicitly takes into account the internal structure of the representation spaces. In particular, this means that the conversion of an operator, given its matrix elements in the irrep basis, to the blocks of the corresponding symmetric `TensorMap` is less straightforward since it requires an understanding of exactly what this implied internal structure is. Therefore, we require some more discussion before we can actually move on to an example.\n",

    "We'll start by discussing the general structure of a `TensorMap` which is symmetric under a non-Abelian group symmetry. We then given an example based on $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$, where we construct the Heisenberg Hamiltonian using two different approaches.

For each irrep space $V^{(l)}$ we can define an orthonormal basis labeled as $\\ket{l, m}$, where the auxiliary label $m$ can take $\\text{dim}\\left( V^{(l)} \\right)$ different values.

The precise nature of this decomposition, also refered to as the *Clebsch-Gordan problem*, is given by the so-called *Clebsch-Gordan coefficients*, which we will denote as $C^{k}_{l_1,l_2}$. This set of coefficients, which can be interpreted as a $\\text{dim}\\left( V^{(l_1)} \\right) \\times \\text{dim}\\left( V^{(l_2)} \\right)  \\times \\text{dim}\\left( V^{(l_3)} \\right)$ array, that encodes how a basis state $\\ket{k,n} \\in V^{(k)}$ corresponding to some term in the direct sum can be decomposed into a linear combination of basis vectors $\\ket{l_1,m_1} \\otimes \\ket{l_2,m_2}$ of the tensor product space:\n",

    "Based on this discussion, we can quantify the aforementioned 'difficulties' in the inverse operation of what we just demonstrated, namely converting a given operator to a symmetric `TensorMap` given only its matrix elements in the irrep basis. Indeed, it is now clear that this precisely requires isolating the reduced matrix elements introduced above. Given the matrix elements of the operator in the irrep basis, this can in general be done by solving the system of equations implied by the [Clebsch-Gordan decomposition](wignereckart). A simpler way to achieve the same thing is to make use of the fact that the [Clebsch-Gordan tensors form a complete orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients#Orthogonality_relations) on the coupled space. Indeed, by projecting out the appropriate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and using their orthogonality relations, we can construct a diagonal operator on each coupled irrep space $V^{(k)}$. Each of these diagonal operators is proportional to the identity, where the proportionality factor is precisely the reduced matrix element associated to the corresponding irrep fusion tree.\n",

In the following we demonstrate this explicit procedure for the particular example of $G = \\mathrm{SU}(2)$. However, it should be noted that for general groups the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients may not be as easy to compute (if it is even known how). In addition, the procedure for manually projecting out the reduced matrix elements requires being particularly careful about the correspondence between the basis states used to define the original matrix elements and those implied by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Therefore, it is often easier to directly construct the symmetric tensor based on some representation theory, as we will see below.\n",

    "We end this subsection with some comments on the generalization of the above discussion to $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$. As foreshadowed above, the irreps of $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ in general have an even more complicated structure. In particular, they can admit so-called *fusion multiplicities*, where the fusion of two irreps can not just have multiple distinct outcomes, but they can even fuse to a given irrep in mutliple inequivalent ways. We can demonstrate this behavior for the adjoint representation of $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$. For this we can use the the [SUNRepresentations.jl](https://github.com/maartenvd/SUNRepresentations.jl/tree/master) package which provides an interface for working with irreps of $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and their Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. A particular representation is represented by an `SUNIrrep{N}` which can be used with TensorKit.jl. The eight-dimensional adjoint representation of $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ is given by"

    "- Add section on product symmetries and how to work with them.\n",
    "    - Use the Hubbard model with $f\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\boxtimes \\mathrm{U}(1) \\boxtimes \\mathrm{SU}(2)$ as an example.\n",
    "- Add a section on classical $O(N)$ models to illustrate the ('Fourier') transformation from the group element to the irrep basis for continuous symmetries."
