    "\n",
    "In order to compute expectation values of such MPOs, we can use the same technique as\n",
    "before, and sandwich the MPO between two MPSs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Insert image of expectation value -->\n",
    "\n",
    "However, care must be taken when the goal is to determine a local expectation value density,\n",
    "as this is not necessarily well-defined. In fact, the MPO represents the sum of all local\n",
    "terms, and sandwiching it will always lead to the total energy. In order to consistently\n",
    "define local contributions, a choice must be made how to *distribute* this among the sites.\n",
    "For example, even in the case of two-site local operators, it is unclear if this local\n",
    "expectation value should be accredited to the left, or right site, or even split between\n",
    "both sites. In the implementation of MPSKit, the chosen convention is to distribute the\n",
    "expectation value evenly among its starting and ending point, in order to not overcount\n",
    "contributions of long-range interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically this is achieved by renormalizing the environment tensors in a particular way,\n",
    "such that then local expectation values can be obtained by either contracting the first row\n",
    "of $W$ with the right regularized environment, or the last column of $W$ with the left\n",
    "regularized environment. This respectively yields the expectation value of all terms\n",
    "starting at that site, or all terms ending at that site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it can prove instructive to write this out explicitly for some small examples to gain\n",
    "some intuition. Doing this programatically, we get all terms starting at some site as\n",
